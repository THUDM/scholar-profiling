{"text": "Satyajit \" Jitu \" Mayor is recognized for his studies on membrane organization and endocytosis . He graduated with a Masters in Chemistry from the Indian Institute of Technology , Mumbai , in 1985 and obtained his Ph . D . in Life Sciences from The Rockefeller University , New York in 1991 . After a post - doctoral fellowship at Columbia University , New York , he returned to India in 1995 to join the newly founded National Centre for Biological Sciences ( NCBS ) , a centre of the Tata Institute for Fundamental Research ( TIFR ) . Currently he is Senior Professor and Director at National Centre for Biological Sciences , and also the Institute for Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine at Bangalore , India . He is a Fellow of the Indian Academy of Sciences , National Academy of Sciences ( India ) , Royal Society of Chemistry , a Foreign Fellow of EMBO , and a Foreign Associate of National Academy of Sciences of the United States . Research Interests Employing a multi - disciplinary approach , Jitu Mayors laboratory has developed new concepts ( nanoscale complexes as units of meso - scale membrane organization ) , new tools ( fluorescence anisotropy microscopy ) and new methodologies ( quantitative physical tools ) to understand and study organization and dynamics of membranes in living cells . This has led an understanding of how a cell regulates local organization of its cell membrane constituents , from the nanometer scale in specialized domains in cell membranes ( termed rafts ) to the micron scale in endocytic pathways . His work has inspired a new picture of the cell membrane as an active composite of a fluid lipid bilayer intertwined with a dynamic cortical cytoskeleton immediately beneath . This has led to the use of the language of active mechanics in addition to existing equilibrium notions to understand how regulated lipid and protein assemblies arise in cell membranes . His work has also provided an understanding of mechanisms and roles for poorly appreciated mechanisms of endocytosis that do not deploy the classical clathrin and dynamin molecular players . Together , Jitu Mayors work is important for understanding how signaling reactions in cell membranes are influenced by local membrane composition and how the global composition of the cell membrane may be regulated .", "tokens": ["Satyajit", "\"", "Jitu", "\"", "Mayor", "is", "recognized", "for", "his", "studies", "on", "membrane", "organization", "and", "endocytosis", ".", "He", "graduated", "with", "a", "Masters", "in", "Chemistry", "from", "the", "Indian", "Institute", "of", "Technology", ",", "Mumbai", ",", "in", "1985", "and", "obtained", "his", "Ph", ".", "D", ".", "in", "Life", "Sciences", "from", "The", "Rockefeller", "University", ",", "New", "York", "in", "1991", ".", "After", "a", "post", "-", "doctoral", "fellowship", "at", "Columbia", "University", ",", "New", "York", ",", "he", "returned", "to", "India", "in", "1995", "to", "join", "the", "newly", "founded", "National", "Centre", "for", "Biological", "Sciences", "(", "NCBS", ")", ",", "a", "centre", "of", "the", "Tata", "Institute", "for", "Fundamental", "Research", "(", "TIFR", ")", ".", "Currently", "he", "is", "Senior", "Professor", "and", "Director", "at", "National", "Centre", "for", "Biological", "Sciences", ",", "and", "also", "the", "Institute", "for", "Stem", "Cell", "Biology", "and", "Regenerative", "Medicine", "at", "Bangalore", ",", "India", ".", "He", "is", "a", "Fellow", "of", "the", "Indian", "Academy", "of", "Sciences", ",", "National", "Academy", "of", "Sciences", "(", "India", ")", ",", "Royal", "Society", "of", "Chemistry", ",", "a", "Foreign", "Fellow", "of", "EMBO", ",", "and", "a", "Foreign", "Associate", "of", "National", "Academy", "of", "Sciences", "of", "the", "United", "States", ".", "Research", "Interests", "Employing", "a", "multi", "-", "disciplinary", "approach", ",", "Jitu", "Mayors", "laboratory", "has", "developed", "new", "concepts", "(", "nanoscale", "complexes", "as", "units", "of", "meso", "-", "scale", "membrane", "organization", ")", ",", "new", "tools", "(", "fluorescence", "anisotropy", "microscopy", ")", "and", "new", "methodologies", "(", "quantitative", "physical", "tools", ")", "to", "understand", "and", "study", "organization", "and", "dynamics", "of", "membranes", "in", "living", "cells", ".", "This", "has", "led", "an", "understanding", "of", "how", "a", "cell", "regulates", "local", "organization", "of", "its", "cell", "membrane", "constituents", ",", "from", "the", "nanometer", "scale", "in", "specialized", "domains", "in", "cell", "membranes", "(", "termed", "rafts", ")", "to", "the", "micron", "scale", "in", "endocytic", "pathways", ".", "His", "work", "has", "inspired", "a", "new", "picture", "of", "the", "cell", "membrane", "as", "an", "active", "composite", "of", "a", "fluid", "lipid", "bilayer", "intertwined", "with", "a", "dynamic", "cortical", "cytoskeleton", "immediately", "beneath", ".", "This", "has", "led", "to", "the", "use", "of", "the", "language", "of", "active", "mechanics", "in", "addition", "to", "existing", "equilibrium", "notions", "to", "understand", "how", "regulated", "lipid", "and", "protein", "assemblies", "arise", "in", "cell", "membranes", ".", "His", "work", "has", "also", "provided", "an", "understanding", "of", "mechanisms", "and", "roles", "for", "poorly", "appreciated", "mechanisms", "of", "endocytosis", "that", "do", "not", "deploy", "the", "classical", "clathrin", "and", "dynamin", "molecular", "players", ".", "Together", ",", "Jitu", "Mayors", "work", "is", "important", "for", "understanding", "how", "signaling", "reactions", "in", "cell", "membranes", "are", "influenced", "by", "local", "membrane", "composition", "and", "how", "the", "global", "composition", "of", "the", "cell", "membrane", "may", "be", "regulated", "."], "record": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_0> gender <extra_id_5> his <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> research interests <extra_id_5> membrane organization and endocytosis <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> education <extra_id_5> He graduated with a Masters in Chemistry from the Indian Institute of Technology , Mumbai , in 1985 and obtained his Ph .

Alex ' s research interests include human - computer interaction , human factors visual analytics to support judgment and decision making , human - robot interaction , social computing , human - automation interaction and decision support is sociotechnical systems such as aviation , space , intelligence analysis , severe weather forecasting , disaster and emergency response , healthcare and medicine , autonomous vehicles , education and so forth . Alex ' s approach to teaching and mentoring students is naturally dependent of the level of instruction involved . Perhaps one notable aspect of his educational approach is that no crisp line can be drawn between his interests and activities in research and teaching . For example , he has advised 2 PhD dissertations on the development and evaluation of new techniques and technologies for teaching engineering design . His research and educational activities also dovetail in the realm of his graduate seminars , which are intensively group - and project - based , typically involving students in actual research projects to motivate and animate the course material . For example , in 2010 Alex seized on an opportunity afforded by a U . S . Challenge . gov Health and Human Services competition that required competing project teams to design a Facebook app that would be useful to people in the aftermath of natural disasters and emergencies . This project not only involved the students , working as a design team , to create a conceptual design for the app , but to also create a working software prototype and a video demo . The competition was open to any group who wanted to enter it was not specifically targeted to the educational community or to educational institutions . The students design earned 3rd place nationally : www . hhs . gov / news / press / 2012pres / 02 / 20120223b . htmlHis current ( Spring , 2017 ) syllabus for his graduate course \" Experimental

{"text": "Barbara Wolfe is the Richard A . Easterlin Professor of Economics , Population Health Sciences , and Public Affairs and Faculty Affiliate at the Institute for Research on Poverty . Her research focuses broadly on poverty and health issues . Wolfe ' s current projects examine whether housing voucher and public housing programs lead to better school performance of children in the household ; how poverty influences critical brain areas among young children and these in turn influence school outcomes ; the influence of growing up with a sibling who is adopted or who has a developmental disability or mental illness , or a sibling who dies , on outcomes as a young adult ; and , a comparison of the effects of early childhood general health , physical health and mental health on long - term earnings and labor force participation . Other recent work addresses effects of the Affordable Care Act , including effects on racial disparities in health care coverage , effects on mental health , and an overview of existing research and prospects for research in the future . Wolfe ' s projects also examine the adequacy of resources when individuals retire and during their first decade of retirement , and the response of these resources to health shocks . She is a member of the National Academy of Medicine ( formerly the Institute of Medicine ) , currently serving on its Roundtable on the application of social and behavioral science research . She served as vice chair of the National Academy of Sciences / Institute of Medicine Board on Children , Youth and Families and as a member of the Advisory Committee to the Director of the National Institutes of Health .

Although researchers had long suspected that the brain controls the function of endocrine glands , they did not know how these interactions occurred throughout the body . They believed the brains hypothalamus released a substance that activated these glands , but no one could find evidence for it . After manipulating 1 . 5 million sheep brains , Guillemins group eventually isolated a molecule called TRH ( thyrotropin - releasing hormone ) , which ultimately controls all the functions of the thyroid gland . In the following years , he and his colleagues isolated other molecules from the hypothalamus that control all functions of the pituitary glandfor instance , GnRH ( gonadotropin - releasing hormone ) , a hypothalamic hormone that causes the pituitary to release gonadotropins , which in turn trigger the release of hormones from the testicles or ovaries . This discovery led to advancements in the medical treatment of infertility and is also used to treat prostate cancer . In 1970 , Guillemin joined the Salk Institute to head the newly established Laboratories for Neuroendocrinology , where he and his group discovered somatostatin , which regulates the activities of the pituitary gland and the pancreas and is used clinically to treat pituitary tumors . He was among the first to isolate endorphins , brain molecules that act as natural opiates , and his work with cellular growth factors ( FGFs ) led to the recognition of multiple physiological functions and developmental mechanisms , including molecules such as inhibins and activins . The recipient of numerous honors , Guillemin was awarded the 1977 Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine for his work with hypothalamic hormones . He is also a member of the National Academy of Sciences and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and has received the Lasker Award in Basic Sciences and the National Medal of Science , among many others . He was selected for the Hall of Honor at the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development ( NICHD ) for exceptional contributions to advancing knowledge and improving maternal and child health , and is listed as one of the most highly cited scientists from 198199 by the Institute for Scientific Information . As interim president of the Institute from 200709 , he was instrumental in bringing art exhibits to the Salk Institute , fulfilling Jonas Salks vision of a facility that blends science and art . In 2015 , Guillemin was presented with France ' s highest accoladethe rank of Commander in the Legion of Honour .", "tokens": ["A", "native", "of", "Dijon", ",", "France", ",", "Guillemin",

{"text": "Mike went on to publish two important follow - ups to the initial 1990 IJGIS paper , including the first comprehensive treatment of object - oriented modeling for both spatial and temporal information . The two articles have been almost as influential as the 1990 piece , with his 1994 article in IJGIS ( \" Object - oriented approaches to geo - referenced information \" ) accumulating at least as many citations , and a 1994 article in The Computer Journal ( \" A unified model of spatial and temporal information \" ) , ranking to date as one of the most heavily - cited papers ever to be published in that outlet . Mike is among the very few researchers to have made a reciprocal impact in multiple disciplines , in this case by bringing computer science concepts to the GIS community , while also demonstrating to computer scientists the power of spatial and temporal modeling . Toward this end , Mike is also the author of the seminal text , Geographic Information Systems : A Computing Perspective , now in its second edition . When this book first appeared in 1995 , it made a great impact on students and professionals alike from a variety of disciplines . As one exemplar , a graduate student wrote : \" This book covers GIS data structures and databases in a way that a computer scientist would appreciate . It covers GIS algorithms in a way that an applied mathematician would like . It covers GIS topology in a way that a pure mathematician could learn from . It covers uncertainty in a way that a statistician would enjoy . \" And to this many would add that it provides the kind of introduction to GIS that geographers very much need . Trained as a mathematician with a Ph . D . in that discipline from the University of Birmingham , England , Mike has previously won the Dean ' s Award of Excellence from the University of Maine , School of Engineering , and the designation of Distinguished Scientist from the Association of Computing Machinery ( ACM ) . He is founding chair of the steering committee for the annual national conference GISRUK , and serves on the editorial boards of the IJGIS , Transactions in GIS , Geoinformatica , and the Journal of Computers in Enviromental and Urban Systems . Mike is a member of the scientific committees of several international GIS and database conferences , and convenor of the UK Research Working Group ( WG3 ) of the National Geospatial Data Framework . In addition to serving as chair of the Department of Spatial Information Science and Engineering at the University of Maine , he is also an adjunct professor in their Department of Mathematics there , as well as a research scientist of the National Center for Geographic Information and Analysis ( NCGIA ) and an honorary professorial fellow of the Department of Geomatics at the University of Melbourne , Australia .", "tokens": ["Mike", "went", "on", "to", "publish", "two", "important", "follow", "-", "ups", "to", "the", "initial", "1990", "IJGIS", "paper", ",", "including", "the", "first", "comprehensive", "treatment", "of", "object", "-", "oriented", "modeling", "for", "both", "spatial", "and", "temporal", "information", ".", "The", "two", "articles", "have", "been", "almost", "as", "influential", "as", "the", "1990", "piece", ",", "with", "his", "1994", "article", "in", "IJGIS", "(", "\"", "Object", "-", "oriented", "approaches", "to", "geo", "-", "referenced", "information", "\"", ")", "accumulating", "at", "least", "as", "many", "citations", ",", "and", "a", "1994", "article", "in", "The", "Computer", "Journal", "(", "\"", "A", "unified", "model", "of", "spatial", "and", "temporal", "information", "\"", ")", ",", "ranking", "to", "date", "as", "one", "of", "the", "most", "heavily", "-", "cited", "papers", "ever", "to", "be", "published", "in", "that", "outlet", ".", "Mike", "is", "among", "the", "very", "few", "researchers", "to", "have", "made", "a", "reciprocal", "impact", "in", "multiple", "disciplines", ",", "in", "this", "case", "by", "bringing", "computer", "science", "concepts", "to", "the", "GIS", "community", ",", "while", "also", "demonstrating", "to", "computer", "scientists", "the", "power", "of", "spatial", "and", "temporal", "modeling", ".", "Toward", "this", "end", ",", "Mike", "is", "also", "the", "author", "of", "the", "seminal", "text", ",", "Geographic", "Information", "Systems", ":", "A", "Computing", "Perspective", ",", "now", "in", "its", "second", "edition", ".", "When", "this", "book", "first", "appeared", "in", "1995", ",", "it", "made", "a", "great", "impact", "on", "students", "and", "professionals", "alike", "from", "a", "variety", "of", "disciplines", ".", "As", "one", "exemplar", ",", "a", "graduate", "student", "wrote", ":", "\"", "This", "book", "covers", "GIS", "data", "structures", "and", "databases", "in", "a", "way", "that", "a", "computer", "scientist", "would", "appreciate", ".", "It", "covers", "GIS", "algorithms", "in", "a", "way", "that", "an", "applied", "mathematician", "would", "like", ".", "It", "covers", "GIS", "topology", "in", "a", "way", "that", "a", "pure", "mathematician", "could", "learn", "from", ".", "It", "covers", "uncertainty", "in", "a", "way", "that", "a", "statistician", "would", "enjoy", ".", "\"", "And", "to", "this", "many", "would", "add", "that", "it", "provides", "the", "kind", "of", "introduction", "to", "GIS", "that", "geographers", "very", "much", "need", ".", "Trained", "as", "a", "mathematician", "with", "a", "Ph", ".", "D", ".", "in", "that", "discipline", "from", "the", "University", "of", "Birmingham", ",", "England", ",", "Mike", "has", "previously", "won", "the", "Dean", "'", "s", "Award", "of", "Excellence", "from", "the", "University", "of", "Maine", ",", "School", "of", "Engineering", ",", "and", "the", "designation", "of", "Distinguished", "Scientist", "from", "the", "Association", "of", "Computing", "Machinery", "(", "ACM", ")", ".", "He", "is", "founding", "chair", "of", "the", "steering", "committee", "for", "the", "annual", "national", "conference", "GISRUK", ",", "and", "serves", "on", "the", "editorial", "boards", "of", "the", "IJGIS", ",", "Transactions", "in", "GIS", ",", "Geoinformatica", ",", "and", "the", "Journal", "of", "Computers", "in", "Enviromental", "and", "Urban", "Systems", ".", "Mike", "is", "a", "member", "of", "the", "scientific", "committees", "of", "several", "international", "GIS", "and", "database", "conferences", ",", "and", "convenor", "of", "the", "UK", "Research", "Working", "Group", "(", "WG3", ")", "of", "the", "National", "Geospatial", "Data", "Framework", ".", "In", "addition", "to", "serving", "as", "chair", "of", "the", "Department", "of", "Spatial", "Information", "Science", "and", "Engineering", "at", "the", "University", "of", "Maine", ",", "he", "is", "also", "an", "adjunct", "professor", "in", "their", "Department", "of", "Mathematics", "there", ",", "as", "well", "as", "a", "research", "scientist", "of", "the", "National", "Center", "for", "Geographic", "Information", "and", "Analysis", "(", "NCGIA", ")", "and", "an", "honorary", "professorial", "fellow", "of", "the", "Department", "of", "Geomatics", "at", "the", "University", "of", "Melbourne", ",", "Australia", "."], "record": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_0> research interests <extra_id_5> the first comprehensive treatment of object -

{"text": "One of the research projects in my laboratory is aimed at understanding the mechanism involved in building the cell plate during cytokinesis in plant cells . The cell plate is built in the center of the phragmoplast , a microtubule held structure by fusion of Golgi - derived vesicles . While the homotypic fusion of small vesicles is likely to give rise to larger vesiclular structures , the vesicles at the cell plate fuse in a unique manner to give rise to a plate instead . This is apparently achieved by a recently identified protein in our laboratory , phragmoplastin , a homolog of dynamin . Phragmoplastin wraps around the vesicles to create dumbbell - shaped structures . A homotypic fusion of these structures is mediated by Knolle , a syntexin , and leads to the formation of a tubulovesicular network . This structure is filled by b - 1 , 3 glucan ( callose ) which applies a sprea Figure 1ding force that closes the holes in the tubular network and create a plate that grows from the center outwards . We have identified several partners of phragmoplastin which play roles in the organization and activation of the b - 1 - 3 glucan synthase complex that begins de novo polysaccharide biosynthesis in this compartment . Since orientation and positioning of the cell plate is vital for plant organogenesis and architecture , particularly at the early stages of embryogenesis , understanding the steps involved in cell plate formation and the role of various players is essential . Finally , the existence of a family of phragmoplastin - like proteins suggests a wider role for this group of proteins in tubularization of membranes . Indeed , we have demonstrated that these proteins are targeted to different subcellular sites , suggesting a diverse role of this group of proteins . Using molecular , genetic and cellular fractionation approaches we plan to dissect the machinery involved in membrane fusion and in the triggering of callose biosynthesis during cell plate formation . We are also studying the mechanism involved in osmotic stress regulation and osmoprotection in plants . The central question is how the stress signaling pathway is linked to the cell growth pathway . For this we have identified a plant TOR kinase that seems to act as a platform to integrate various stress signals and transduce them to respective effectors to control translation and transcription of specific genes involved in cell growth . This is a new area of study and holds significant potential for plant biology and biology at - large as this pathway controls cell growth in all eucaryotic organisms .", "tokens": ["One", "of", "the",

{"text": "Professor Emeritus Hans C . Andersen applies statistical mechanics to develop theoretical understanding of the structure and dynamics of liquids and new computer simulation methods to aid in these studies . He was born in 1941 in Brooklyn , New York . He studied chemistry as an undergraduate , then physical chemistry as a doctoral candidate at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology ( B . S . 1962 , Ph . D . 1966 ) . At MIT he first learned about using a combination of mathematical techniques and the ideas of statistical mechanics to investigate problems of chemical and physical interest . This has been the focus of his research ever since . He joined the Stanford Department of Chemistry as Assistant Professor in 1968 , and became Professor of Chemistry in 1980 . He was named David Mulvane Ehrsam and Edward Curtis Franklin Professor in Chemistry in 1994 . Professor Andersen served as department chairman from 2002 through 2005 . Among many honors , his work has been recognized in the Theoretical Chemistry Award and Hildebrand Award in Theoretical and Experimental Chemistry of Liquids from the American Chemical Society , as well as the Dean ' s Award for Distinguished Teaching and Walter J . Gores Award for Excellence in Teaching at Stanford . He has been elected a member of the National Academy of Sciences , and a fellow of both the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and American Association for the Advancement of Science . Professor Andersens research program has used both traditional statistical mechanical theory and molecular dynamics computer simulation . Early in his career , he was one of the developers of what has come to be known as the Weeks - Chandler - Andersen theory of liquids , which is a way of understanding the structure , thermodynamics , and dynamics of simple dense liquids . Later , he developed several new simulation techniques now in common use for exploring the behavior of liquids , such as simulation of a system under constant pressure and / or temperature . He used computer simulations of normal and supercooled liquids to study the temperature dependence of molecular motion in liquids , crystallization in supercooled liquids , and the structure of amorphous solids . Professor Andersen also developed and analyzed a class of simple lattice models , called facilitated kinetic Ising models , which were then widely used by others to provide insight into the dynamics of real liquids . He simulated simple models of rigid rod polymers to understand the dynamics of this type of material . More recently , in collaboration with Professor Greg Voth of the University of Chicago , he has applied statistical mechanical ideas to the development of coarse grained models of liquids and biomolecules . Such models can be used to simulate molecular systems on long time scales . He has also used mode coupling theory to describe and interpret experiments on rotational relaxation in supercooled liquids and nematogens , in collaboration with Professor Michael Fayer of the Stanford Chemistry Department .", "tokens": ["Professor", "Emeritus", "Hans", "C", ".", "Andersen", "applies", "statistical", "mechanics", "to", "develop", "theoretical", "understanding", "of", "the",

{"text": "After completing my PhD , I held postdoctoral positions at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center and the University of Munich . I returned to Monash University as a Lecturer in the Department of Mathematics , rising through the ranks to become a Full Professor . I am now a Professor in the newly - formed School of Earth , Atmosphere and Environment . Research interests My research has been focused principally on the science of weather producing systems ( such as fronts , extra - tropical cyclones , hurricanes , gravity waves ) . This work is a blend of theory , computer modelling and observations ( having been a chief investigator in 12 major field experiments in Australia and overseas ) . My early research concentrated on the dynamics of the summertime cold fronts that affect southeastern Australia . I was one of the first researchers to explain the role of the planetary boundary layer in the processes of frontogenesis ( Reeder and Smith 1986 ) , and in one of the most influential papers in the field , I explored the dynamical differences between cold fronts and gravity currents ( Smith and Reeder 1988 ) . More recently , I have focused this attention on the cold fronts that affect the continental subtropics and have explained why these fronts strengthen and accelerate at night , but virtually disappear during the day ( Smith et al . 1995 , Reeder et al . 2000 ) . My work has made major contributions to understanding the how gravity waves are generated by non - orographic sources , including fronts and jets ( Reeder and Griffiths 1996 ) , sea breezes ( Goler and Reeder 2006 ) and tropical convection ( Lane et al . 2001 ) . The key contributions in these areas have been to : determine how gravity waves are generated by tropical convection ; clarify the role gravity waves play in organizing tropical convection ; discover the diurnal modulation of fronts over the central part of the continent and determine how this leads to solitary wave generation ( the southerly morning glory ) ; and explain the dynamics processes by which jet - front systems emit gravity waves . I work also in the field of bushfire science . The most important contribution to this area has been a coupled atmosphere - bushfire model capable of simulating bushfires in realistic atmospheric conditions and in complex topography ( Clarke et al . 2003 ) . The model developed attracted considerable media attention . Although it has long been known that the interaction between the atmosphere and the bushfire plays a key role in determining the behaviour and spread of the fire , little quantitative work has been done on the problem - this is the main direction of my current bushfire research .

{"text": "One of the main and continuously sustained activities of his group has been devoted to the development of state - of - the - art laser spectroscopic methods for the detection of trace gasses relevant for biological and medical sciences . Currently , mid - IR Optical Parametric Oscillators and Quantum Cascade Lasers are used for this , next to latest solid - state laser and optical fiber technology . The focus is , thereby , on state - of - the - art detection of substances at sub - part per billion ( volume ) concentrations , on - line , non - invasive , with high selectivity and detection speed . This has led to new insights about the importance of gas exchange in biological and human tissue . In the past , the EU has recognized the research of the group by financially supporting the facility ( in the 4th , 5th and 6th Framework programmes ) www . ru . nl / tracegasfacility . Research has gained better insight to plant physiology based upon the important , world - best sensitive detection of the plant hormone ethylene . Fermentation processes have been studied via the volatile emissions of ethanol and acetaldehyde from plants and fruit under low oxygen conditions and for the first time direct NO emission has been observed from plants . The last years his research moved to mid - infrared Frequency Comb lasers and Supercontinuum sources for the use in Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy . With these systems , a broad spectral coverage at seconds timescale detections became possible , able to deliver at once high resolution , high accuracy , broad spectral coverage and rapid acquisition . He published 230 articles ( H=44 ) in refereed journals , presented 97 invited lectures and had 445 other contributions to national and international conferences . In addition , his group had 60 appearances in the general media and other contributions to public events . He had 50 successful applications on research grants at national and international level . With these grants 22 postdocs and 22 PhD students were employed , next to this he supervised 55 bachelor / master students . Among the postdocs , 8 have reached permanent positions at an academic level , and 2 postdocs started a spinoff company . He is member of the international program committees of the International Conference on Field Laser Applications in Industry and Research ( FLAIR ) , Cavity Enhanced Spectroscopy , International User meeting and Summer school , and the OSA Light , Energy and the Environment Congress . He was reviewer of the several EU ( FP6 , FP7 and H2020 ) and US ( SBIR , DoE , NSF ) programmes , next to numerous National programmes .", "tokens": ["One", "of", "the", "main", "and", "continuously", "sustained", "activities", "of", "his", "group", "has", "been", "devoted", "to", "the", "development", "of", "state", "-", "of", "-", "the", "-", "art", "laser", "spectroscopic", "methods", "for", "the", "detection", "of", "trace", "gasses", "relevant", "for", "biological", "and", "medical", "sciences", ".", "Currently", ",", "mid", "-", "IR", "Optical", "Parametric", "Oscillators", "and", "Quantum", "Cascade", "Lasers", "are", "used", "for", "this", ",", "next", "to", "latest", "solid", "-", "state", "laser", "and", "optical", "fiber", "technology", ".", "The", "focus", "is", ",", "thereby", ",", "on", "state", "-", "of", "-", "the", "-", "art", "detection", "of", "substances", "at", "sub", "-", "part", "per", "billion", "(", "volume", ")", "concentrations", ",", "on", "-", "line", ",", "non", "-", "invasive", ",", "with", "high", "selectivity", "and", "detection", "speed", ".", "This", "has", "led", "to", "new", "insights", "about", "the", "importance", "of", "gas", "exchange", "in", "biological", "and", "human", "tissue", ".", "In", "the", "past", ",", "the", "EU", "has", "recognized", "the", "research", "of", "the", "group", "by", "financially", "supporting", "the", "facility", "(", "in", "the", "4th", ",", "5th", "and", "6th", "Framework", "programmes", ")", "www", ".", "ru", ".", "nl", "/", "tracegasfacility", ".", "Research", "has", "gained", "better", "insight", "to", "plant", "physiology", "based", "upon", "the", "important", ",", "world", "-", "best", "sensitive", "detection", "of", "the", "plant", "hormone", "ethylene", ".", "Fermentation", "processes", "have", "been", "studied", "via", "the", "volatile", "emissions", "of", "ethanol", "and", "acetaldehyde", "from", "plants", "and", "fruit", "under", "low", "oxygen", "conditions", "and", "for", "the", "first", "time", "direct", "NO", "emission", "has", "been", "observed", "from", "plants", ".", "The", "last", "years", "his", "research", "moved", "to", "mid", "-", "infrared", "Frequency", "Comb", "lasers", "and", "Supercontinuum", "sources", "for", "the", "use", "in", "Fourier", "Transform", "Infrared", "Spectroscopy", ".", "With", "these", "systems", ",", "a", "broad", "spectral", "coverage", "at", "seconds", "timescale", "detections", "became", "possible", ",", "able", "to", "deliver", "at", "once", "high", "resolution", ",", "high", "accuracy", ",", "broad", "spectral", "coverage", "and", "rapid", "acquisition", ".", "He", "published", "230", "articles", "(", "H=44", ")", "in", "refereed", "journals", ",", "presented", "97", "invited", "lectures", "and", "had", "445", "other", "contributions", "to", "national", "and", "international", "conferences", ".", "In", "addition", ",", "his", "group", "had", "60", "appearances", "in", "the", "general", "media", "and", "other", "contributions", "to", "public", "events", ".", "He", "had", "50", "successful", "applications", "on", "research", "grants", "at", "national", "and", "international", "level", ".", "With", "these", "grants", "22", "postdocs", "and", "22", "PhD", "students", "were", "employed", ",", "next", "to", "this", "he", "supervised", "55", "bachelor", "/", "master", "students", ".", "Among", "the", "postdocs", ",", "8", "have", "reached", "permanent", "positions", "at", "an", "academic", "level", ",", "and", "2", "postdocs", "started", "a", "spinoff", "company", ".", "He", "is", "member", "of", "the", "international", "program", "committees", "of", "the", "International", "Conference", "on", "Field", "Laser", "Applications", "in", "Industry", "and", "Research", "(", "FLAIR", ")", ",", "Cavity", "Enhanced", "Spectroscopy", ",", "International", "User", "meeting", "and", "Summer", "school", ",", "and", "the", "OSA", "Light", ",", "Energy", "and", "the", "Environment", "Congress", ".", "He", "was", "reviewer", "of", "the", "several", "EU", "(", "FP6", ",", "FP7", "and", "H2020", ")", "and", "US", "(", "SBIR", ",", "DoE", ",", "NSF", ")", "programmes", ",", "next", "to", "numerous", "National", "programmes", "."], "record": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_0> gender <extra_id_5> his <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> research interests <extra_id_5> the development of state - of - the - art laser spectroscopic methods for the detection of trace gasses relevant for biological and medical sciences <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> take office <extra_id_5> He is member of the international program committees of the International Conference on Field Laser Applications in Industry and Research ( FLAIR ) , Cavity Enhanced Spectroscopy , International User meeting and Summer school , and the OSA Light , Energy and the Environment Congress .

{"text": "1 . Biotechnology and Biomaterials A major theme of our studies is the interfacial behaviour of proteins which is of great importance in biotechnology , diagnostics , and medical devices . Many of the products of biotechnology are genetically engineered proteins - e . g . insulin and growth factors . Processing presents unique problems due to the instability of these complex macro - molecules . For example , chromatography involving interaction of the proteins with solid surfaces is often used in final purification but can lead to molecular distortion and a biologically inactive , even though pure , product . An example in the medical devices field is blood compatible materials for arterial grafts , blood pumps and heart valves . A major unsolved problem here is blood coagulation / thrombosis believed to be initiated by the adsorption of plasma proteins to the surface of the implant . In these contexts we are studying the adsorption of a range of proteins using tube flow , serum replacement ( equivalent to CSTR ) , and packed column experiments in conjunction with radio labelled proteins . Media range from buffered solutions to blood . Specific interests are the kinetics , equilibria and reversibility of adsorption and changes in the structure and biologic function of adsorbed proteins . A prime objective is to correlate specific interactions with surface properties , e . g . wettability , electric charge , chemical composition . Materials for study , mostly polymers , are synthesized in the laboratory or are acquired from collaborating research groups around the world . 2 . Polymerization and Polymer Characterization This work is on condensation polymerization and is mainly concerned with segmented polyurethanes , a versatile class of thermoplastic elastomers . Objectives are to improve understanding of structure - property relationships , to develop methods for \" tailoring \" surface properties , and to develop \" bioactive \" polyurethanes having specific biological activity . An example of the latter are surfaces which will activate the fibrinolytic ( clot dissolving system ) in blood . 3 . Modification of Surfaces for Biotechnology Applications Surface modification of materials is of considerable current interest in biotechnology applications such as biosensors and diagnostic devices . In general one wants to keep the bulk properties of the material intact while tailoring the surface to impart properties such as resistance to fouling or binding of a specific molecule from a contacting biofluid . We are developing a program in this area based on two approaches : ( a ) gas plasma treatment of polymer surfaces , ( b ) chemical grafting ( c ) modification of surfaces via exploitation of gold - thiol chemistry . In the latter , the surface is coated with a thin film of gold which is then treated with appropriate thiolates to give the desired properties . In some cases the resulting layers have unique properties through ordering and self assembly .", "tokens": ["1", ".", "Biotechnology", "and", "Biomaterials", "A", "major", "theme", "of", "our",

{"text": "Peter M . Senge is the founding chair of SoL ( Society of Organizational Learning ) , a global network of organizations , researchers , and consultants dedicated to the interdependent development of people and their institutions , Senior Lecturer , Sloan School of Management MIT , and cofounder of the Academy for Systemic Change , which seeks to accelerate the growth of the field of systemic change worldwide . His work centers on promoting shared understanding of complex issues and shared leadership for healthier human systems . This involves major cross - sector projects focused on global food systems , climate change , regenerative economies , and the future of education . Peter is the author of The Fifth Discipline and coauthor of the three related fieldbooks : Presence , and The Necessary Revolution . The Fifth Discipline ( over two million copies sold ) , was recognized by Harvard Business Review as one of the seminal management books of the last 75 years , and by the Financial Times as one of five most important management books . The Journal of Business Strategy named him one of the 24 people who had the greatest influence on business strategy in the 20th century . Recently , he was named to the 1000 Talents Program ( Renzai ) in China to help China become a leader in systemic change , to benefit itself and the world . Peter has been at the forefront of organizational learning since publishing his classic text , The Fifth Discipline , in 1990 . The Fifth Discipline provides the theories and methods to foster aspiration , develop reflective conversation , and understand complexity in order to build a learning organization . Peter is driven by the desire to understand how we can work together to live in harmony with one another and with Mother Earth . He continues to push the boundaries of our understanding of organizational learning , teaching his principles in workshops and seminars across the country . Peter describes his process as sharing rather than teaching , in an attempt to help people see not just what has been done before , but sharing what has been done , by suggestion , surfacing , or eliciting what new might be possible . Throughout his career , Peter has been asking , How do we create the best conditions , including the tools and methods , for enabling learning communities ? Since the publication of The Fifth Discipline , Peter has shared the driving principles of organizational learning with business , education , health care , and government . Through his work , Peter strives to foster learning communities around the globe in order to improve our world .", "tokens": ["Peter", "M", ".", "Senge", "is", "the", "founding", "chair", "of", "SoL", "(", "Society", "of", "Organizational", "Learning", ")", ",", "a", "global", "network", "of", "organizations", ",", "researchers", ",", "and", "consultants", "dedicated", "to", "the", "interdependent", "development", "of", "people", "and", "their", "institutions", ",", "Senior", "Lecturer", ",", "Sloan", "School", "of", "Management", "MIT", ",", "and", "cofounder", "of", "the", "Academy", "for", "Systemic", "Change", ",", "which", "seeks", "to", "accelerate", "the", "growth", "of", "the", "field", "of", "systemic", "change", "worldwide", ".", "His", "work", "centers", "on", "promoting", "shared", "understanding", "of", "complex", "issues", "and", "shared", "leadership", "for", "healthier", "human", "systems", ".", "This", "involves", "major", "cross", "-", "sector", "projects", "focused", "on", "global", "food", "systems", ",", "climate", "change", ",", "regenerative", "economies", ",", "and", "the", "future", "of", "education", ".", "Peter", "is", "the", "author", "of", "The", "Fifth", "Discipline", "and", "coauthor", "of", "the", "three", "related", "fieldbooks", ":", "Presence", ",", "and", "The", "Necessary", "Revolution", ".", "The", "Fifth", "Discipline", "(", "over", "two", "million", "copies", "sold", ")", ",", "was", "recognized", "by", "Harvard", "Business", "Review", "as", "one", "of", "the", "seminal", "management", "books", "of", "the", "last", "75", "years", ",", "and", "by", "the", "Financial", "Times", "as", "one", "of", "five", "most", "important", "management", "books", ".", "The", "Journal", "of", "Business", "Strategy", "named", "him", "one", "of", "the", "24", "people", "who", "had", "the", "greatest", "influence", "on", "business", "strategy", "in", "the", "20th", "century", ".", "Recently", ",", "he", "was", "named", "to", "the", "1000", "Talents", "Program", "(", "Renzai", ")", "in", "China", "to", "help", "China", "become", "a", "leader", "in", "systemic", "change", ",", "to", "benefit", "itself", "and", "the", "world", ".", "Peter", "has", "been", "at", "the", "forefront", "of", "organizational", "learning", "since", "publishing", "his", "classic", "text", ",", "The", "Fifth", "Discipline", ",", "in", "1990", ".", "The", "Fifth", "Discipline", "provides", "the", "theories", "and", "methods", "to", "foster", "aspiration", ",", "develop", "reflective", "conversation", ",", "and", "understand", "complexity", "in", "order", "to", "build", "a", "learning", "organization", ".", "Peter", "is", "driven", "by", "the", "desire", "to", "understand", "how", "we", "can", "work", "together", "to", "live", "in", "harmony", "with", "one", "another", "and", "with", "Mother", "Earth", ".", "He", "continues", "to", "push", "the", "boundaries", "of", "our", "understanding", "of", "organizational", "learning", ",", "teaching", "his", "principles", "in", "workshops", "and", "seminars", "across", "the", "country", ".", "Peter", "describes", "his", "process", "as", "sharing", "rather", "than", "teaching", ",", "in", "an", "attempt", "to", "help", "people", "see", "not", "just", "what", "has", "been", "done", "before", ",", "but", "sharing", "what", "has", "been", "done", ",", "by", "suggestion", ",", "surfacing", ",", "or", "eliciting", "what", "new", "might", "be", "possible", ".", "Throughout", "his", "career", ",", "Peter", "has", "been", "asking", ",", "How", "do", "we", "create", "the", "best", "conditions", ",", "including", "the", "tools", "and", "methods", ",", "for", "enabling", "learning", "communities", "?", "Since", "the", "publication", "of", "The", "Fifth", "Discipline", ",", "Peter", "has", "shared", "the", "driving", "principles", "of", "organizational", "learning", "with", "business", ",", "education", ",", "health", "care", ",", "and", "government", ".", "Through", "his", "work", ",", "Peter", "strives", "to", "foster", "learning", "communities", "around", "the", "globe", "in", "order", "to", "improve", "our", "world", "."], "record": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_0> work record <extra_id_5> Peter M .

Presently his team works on the physical mechanism for generation and transmission of pulsed electromagnetic waves in neurons , brain and among cells , and micro / nano - sensors for real - time 2D , 3D mapping of thermal and electrical fields . Prof . Xu and his coworkers have presented an original model for soft - material waveguide , where they address 3 major roles a cell membrane plays for electrical communication in a natural biosystem , i . e . , the framework for a capacitor - like electrical power supply with a transmembrane gradient of ion concentration , the framework for embedded protein ion - channels which generate transient transmembrane ionic currents thus pulsed electromagnetic ( EM ) wave when triggered open , and , the framework of soft - material EM waveguides for transmission of the soliton - like , pulsed EM waves . The electrolyte - membrane - electrolyte sandwich structure allows a perpendicular pulse of electric field , which is generated by the embedded ion - channels , propagate much longer distance along the membrane than in other directions . This model explains well some interesting phenomena in biosystems , for example , transmission of action potential between two nodes of Ranvier in a myelinated axon , simultaneous triggering of billions of ion - channels within 1 ms in an electric eel , and transmission of electric signals among normal cells of both animals and plants . The results shed some light on the physical mechanism of muscle , heart , and brain . Prof . Xus team also developed the smallest thin - film thermocouples ( TFTCs ) with width < 150 nm , a variety of real - time 2d mapping techniques for local temperature distributions , and double - stabilized systems with thermal noises as small as 5 mk near room temperature , so that the slight increment of local temperatures for cultured individual cells , in the order of 50 - 300 mk , has been detected . these development leads to smart probes for measuring inner 3d fields of live animals .", "tokens": ["Prof", ".", "Xu", "has", "years", "of", "experience", "in", "epitaxial", "superconducting", "thin", "films", "(", "YBCO", ",", "MgB2", ")", "and", "nanowires", "(", "Zn", ",", "Sn", ",", "etc", ".", ")", ",", "nanomaterials", "and", "micro", "/", "nano", "-", "devices", ".", "Presently", "his", "team", "works", "on", "the", "physical", "mechanism", "for", "generation", "and", "transmission", "of", "pulsed", "electromagnetic", "waves", "in", "neurons", ",", "brain", "and", "among", "cells", ",", "and", "micro", "/", "nano", "-", "sensors", "for", "real", "-", "time", "2D", ",", "3D", "mapping", "of", "thermal", "and", "electrical", "fields", ".", "Prof", ".", "Xu", "and", "his", "coworkers", "have", "presented", "an", "original", "model", "for", "soft", "-", "material", "waveguide", ",", "where", "they", "address", "3", "major", "roles", "a", "cell", "membrane", "plays", "for", "electrical", "communication", "in", "a", "natural", "biosystem", ",", "i", ".", "e", ".", ",", "the", "framework", "for", "a", "capacitor", "-", "like", "electrical", "power", "supply", "with", "a", "transmembrane", "gradient", "of", "ion", "concentration", ",", "the", "framework", "for", "embedded", "protein", "ion", "-", "channels", "which", "generate", "transient", "transmembrane", "ionic", "currents", "thus", "pulsed", "electromagnetic", "(", "EM", ")", "wave", "when", "triggered", "open", ",", "and", ",", "the", "framework", "of", "soft", "-", "material", "EM", "waveguides", "for", "transmission", "of", "the", "soliton", "-", "like", ",", "pulsed", "EM", "waves", ".", "The", "electrolyte", "-", "membrane", "-", "electrolyte", "sandwich", "structure", "allows", "a", "perpendicular", "pulse", "of", "electric", "field", ",", "which", "is", "generated", "by", "the", "embedded", "ion", "-", "channels", ",", "propagate", "much", "longer", "distance", "along", "the", "membrane", "than", "in", "other", "directions", ".", "This", "model", "explains", "well", "some", "interesting", "phenomena", "in", "biosystems", ",", "for", "example", ",", "transmission", "of", "action", "potential", "between", "two", "nodes", "of", "Ranvier", "in", "a", "myelinated", "axon", ",", "simultaneous", "triggering", "of", "billions", "of", "ion", "-", "channels", "within", "1", "ms", "in", "an", "electric", "eel", ",", "and", "transmission", "of", "electric", "signals", "among", "normal", "cells", "of", "both", "animals", "and", "plants", ".", "The", "results", "shed", "some", "light", "on", "the", "physical", "mechanism", "of", "muscle", ",", "heart", ",", "and", "brain", ".", "Prof", ".", "Xus", "team", "also", "developed", "the", "smallest", "thin", "-", "film", "thermocouples", "(", "TFTCs", ")", "with", "width", "<", "150", "nm", ",", "a", "variety", "of", "real", "-", "time", "2d", "mapping", "techniques", "for", "local", "temperature", "distributions", ",", "and", "double", "-", "stabilized", "systems", "with", "thermal", "noises", "as", "small", "as", "5", "mk", "near", "room", "temperature", ",", "so", "that", "the", "slight", "increment", "of", "local", "temperatures", "for", "cultured", "individual", "cells", ",", "in", "the", "order", "of", "50", "-", "300", "mk", ",", "has", "been", "detected", ".", "these", "development", "leads", "to", "smart", "probes", "for", "measuring", "inner", "3d", "fields", "of", "live", "animals", "."], "record": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_0> research interests <extra_id_5> the physical mechanism for generation and transmission of pulsed electromagnetic waves in neurons , brain and among cells , and micro / nano - sensors for real - time 2D , 3D mapping of thermal and electrical fields <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1>", "entity": [{"type": "research interests", "offset": [41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78], "text": "the physical mechanism for generation and transmission of pulsed electromagnetic waves in neurons , brain and among cells , and micro / nano - sensors for real - time 2D , 3D mapping of thermal and electrical fields"}], "relation": [], "event": [], "spot": ["research interests"], "asoc": [], "spot_asoc": [{"span": "the physical mechanism for generation and transmission of pulsed electromagnetic waves in neurons , brain and among cells , and micro / nano - sensors for real - time 2D , 3D mapping of thermal and electrical fields", "label": "research interests", "asoc": []}]}

{"text": "As a theoretical cosmologist , my main aim is to determine the content of the Universe , its evolution and characteristics now and at very early times . While these questions have been outstanding issues for Humankind for centuries , we are now in the position to address them is a quantitative way through the study of astrophysical objects outside our own Galaxy . Two major astrophysical observables can be invoked for this purpose : the Cosmic Microwave Background ( CMB ) radiation , otherwise known as the radiation that comes to us almost from the times of the Big Bang , and the distribution of galaxies beyond our own . The study of such anisotropies has tremendously advanced the knowledge of the field . Indeed , they convey very straightforward information on the global geometry of the Universe , the kind of matter and energy it contains and also the kind of processes that very early on have seeded the inhomogeneities which have then evolved into the observed bound structures around us ( e . g . galaxies and clusters of galaxies ) . One of my research topics consists in testing possible theoretical scenarios of our Universe by comparing the predictions it would imply for these anisotropies with the actual observations . My group has been involved in the data analysis of the last CMB satellite ( Planck ) and it is now working with two other collaborations ( the Simons Observatory and CMB - S4 ) to better map this primordial radiation and potentially shed light on the existence of primordial gravitational waves . Apart from the CMB , I also extensively work on galaxy clusters . Clusters are the biggest gravitationallybound objects in our Universe and are composed of dark matter , galaxies and free gas ( free charged particles ) . Clusters are important for two reasons : first they are tracers of the underlying matter distribution , second they form for gravitational collapse ( contrasting cosmic expansion ) and merging events of smaller objects ( like galaxies ) . Studying clusters we can therefore probe the nature of the dark energy ( leading the current expansion ) , dark matter and the assembly of luminous matter .", "tokens": ["As", "a", "theoretical", "cosmologist", ",", "my", "main", "aim", "is", "to", "determine", "the", "content", "of", "the", "Universe", ",", "its", "evolution", "and", "characteristics", "now", "and", "at", "very", "early", "times", ".", "While", "these", "questions", "have", "been", "outstanding", "issues", "for", "Humankind", "for", "centuries", ",", "we", "are", "now", "in", "the", "position", "to", "address", "them", "is", "a", "quantitative", "way", "through", "the", "study", "of", "astrophysical", "objects", "outside", "our", "own", "Galaxy", ".", "Two", "major", "astrophysical", "observables", "can", "be", "invoked", "for", "this", "purpose", ":", "the", "Cosmic", "Microwave", "Background", "(", "CMB", ")", "radiation", ",", "otherwise", "known", "as", "the", "radiation", "that", "comes", "to", "us", "almost", "from", "the", "times", "of", "the", "Big", "Bang", ",", "and", "the", "distribution", "of", "galaxies", "beyond", "our", "own", ".", "The", "study", "of", "such", "anisotropies", "has", "tremendously", "advanced", "the", "knowledge", "of", "the", "field", ".", "Indeed", ",", "they", "convey", "very", "straightforward", "information", "on", "the", "global", "geometry", "of", "the", "Universe", ",", "the", "kind", "of", "matter", "and", "energy", "it", "contains", "and", "also", "the", "kind", "of", "processes", "that", "very", "early", "on", "have", "seeded", "the", "inhomogeneities", "which", "have", "then", "evolved", "into", "the", "observed", "bound", "structures", "around", "us", "(", "e", ".", "g", ".", "galaxies", "and", "clusters", "of", "galaxies", ")", ".", "One", "of", "my", "research", "topics", "consists", "in", "testing", "possible", "theoretical", "scenarios", "of", "our", "Universe", "by", "comparing", "the", "predictions", "it", "would", "imply", "for", "these", "anisotropies", "with", "the", "actual", "observations", ".", "My", "group", "has", "been", "involved", "in", "the", "data", "analysis", "of", "the", "last", "CMB", "satellite", "(", "Planck", ")", "and", "it", "is", "now", "working", "with", "two", "other", "collaborations", "(", "the", "Simons", "Observatory", "and", "CMB", "-", "S4", ")", "to", "better", "map", "this", "primordial", "radiation", "and", "potentially", "shed", "light", "on", "the", "existence", "of", "primordial", "gravitational", "waves", ".", "Apart", "from", "the", "CMB", ",", "I", "also", "extensively", "work", "on", "galaxy", "clusters", ".", "Clusters", "are", "the", "biggest", "gravitationallybound", "objects", "in", "our", "Universe", "and", "are", "composed", "of", "dark", "matter", ",", "galaxies", "and", "free", "gas", "(", "free", "charged", "particles", ")", ".", "Clusters", "are", "important", "for", "two", "reasons", ":", "first", "they", "are", "tracers", "of", "the", "underlying", "matter", "distribution", ",", "second", "they", "form", "for", "gravitational", "collapse", "(", "contrasting", "cosmic", "expansion", ")", "and", "merging", "events", "of", "smaller", "objects", "(", "like", "galaxies", ")", ".", "Studying", "clusters", "we", "can", "therefore", "probe", "the", "nature", "of", "the", "dark", "energy", "(", "leading", "the", "current", "expansion", ")", ",", "dark", "matter", "and", "the", "assembly", "of", "luminous", "matter", "."], "record": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_0> research interests <extra_id_5> determine the content of the Universe , its evolution and characteristics now and at very early times <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1>", "entity": [{"type": "research interests", "offset": [10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26], "text": "determine the content of the Universe , its evolution and characteristics now and at very early times"}], "relation": [], "event": [], "spot": ["research interests"], "asoc": [], "spot_asoc": [{"span": "determine the content of the Universe , its evolution and characteristics now and at very early times", "label": "research interests", "asoc": []}]}

{"text": "The majority of interesting reactions from a biological , environmental , or engineering perspective occur in fluid condensed phase environments . In such an environment a chemical reaction is controlled by intermolecular interactions with the surrounding solvent bath as well as by the intramolecular Hamiltonian . Interaction with the solvent often results in a situation where reactions are controlled by the competition between intramolecular and intermolecular energy relaxation on time scales ranging from femtoseconds to picoseconds . In the laboratory , state - of - the - art ultrafast lasers and spectroscopic techniques are employed in the observation and control of photoinitiated reactions . These investigations are made possible by the continuing development of tunable femtosecond light sources from the far UV to the near IR , and the development of techniques to precisely control the phase and amplitude of coherent light pulses . The principle objectives of the research program in our group are : ( 1 ) To develop a detailed understanding of the fundamental processes which govern chemical reaction dynamics in fluid environments . Studies of small molecules permit connections between theoretical calculations and experimental measurements . We are using ultrafast spectroscopy and theoretical modeling to investigate isomerization dynamics in small polyene molecules . ( 2 ) To use \" designer \" light pulses to control chemical reactions in condensed phases . Bond - selective control of chemical reactions has been a long standing goal of modern chemical physics . Early attempts using selective laser excitation were thwarted by fast intramolecular energy redistribution . Now ultrafast laser pulses , optical pulse shaping , and feedback algorithms have been successfully combined to control bond dissociation reactions in simple isolated molecules . We are using coherent sculpted light pulses to control unimolecular bond dissociation , and isomerization reactions in solution . ( 3 ) To use short pulses to establish synchronization and study enzyme mechanism in complicated biological systems .

{"text": "Petroleum reservoir simulation , improved and enhanced oil recovery , transient testing in wells , and geomechanics simulation - Marathon Center of Excellence for Reservoir Studies Our understanding of reservoir performance is increased through the study of fluid flow principles , a clear description of reservoir geology , and the judicious use of appropriate reservoir models and simulators . This allows us to evaluate \" what if \" production alternatives to produce the reservoir most efficiently and economically . The detailed reservoir heterogeneity must be carefully accounted in recovery calculations . Laboratory experiments are generally conducted at too small a scale compared to the reservoir scale , but we must nevertheless be able to translate laboratory results to field - scale calculations . Another major problem revolves around the inefficient contact of the reservoir fluid with the displacing fluid because of channeling and frontal instabilities known as fingering . We must be able to predict accurately fluid channeling and fingering and develop techniques to alleviate such problems . The recognition and prediction of flow channeling can be accomplished from the analysis of the reservoir rock , fluid properties , water / oil and gas / oil ratios , tracer signature , and pressure - transient response . Practical reservoir simulators are based on finite - difference and finite - element discretization schemes . I do not anticipate any major changes in these numerical approaches in the foreseeable future . The research in this area must include judicious and efficient use of local mesh refinement to account for reservoir heterogeneities ( channels , fractures , vugs , layers , and discontinuities ) . Furthermore , we must learn to improve the mathematical implementation of the correct physics in such simulators . Finally , robust and efficient mathematical algorithms ( e . g . , equation solvers , vapor / Iiquid equilibrium calculations , relative permeability hysteresis tracking ) must be developed in anticipation of routinely using very large reservoir models with more than 1 , 000 , 000 nodes . I like to do research on various aspects of reservoir engineering ( especially with a strong emphasis on the physics of flow in porous media ) , reservoir description , and mathematical modeling ( both analytical and numerical ) . I want to work with students who are perceptive , have strong mathematical background , work hard , have self - initiative , and can transfer scientific ideas to practical applications .", "tokens": ["Petroleum", "reservoir", "simulation", ",", "improved", "and", "enhanced", "oil", "recovery", ",", "transient", "testing", "in", "wells", ",", "and", "geomechanics", "simulation", "-", "Marathon", "Center", "of", "Excellence", "for", "Reservoir", "Studies", "Our", "understanding", "of", "reservoir", "performance", "is", "increased", "through", "the", "study", "of", "fluid", "flow", "principles", ",", "a", "clear", "description", "of", "reservoir", "geology", ",", "and", "the", "judicious", "use", "of", "appropriate", "reservoir", "models", "and", "simulators", ".", "This", "allows", "us", "to", "evaluate", "\"", "what", "if", "\"", "production", "alternatives", "to", "produce", "the", "reservoir", "most", "efficiently", "and", "economically", ".", "The", "detailed", "reservoir", "heterogeneity", "must", "be", "carefully", "accounted", "in", "recovery", "calculations", ".", "Laboratory", "experiments", "are", "generally", "conducted", "at", "too", "small", "a", "scale", "compared", "to", "the", "reservoir", "scale", ",", "but", "we", "must", "nevertheless", "be", "able", "to", "translate", "laboratory", "results", "to", "field", "-", "scale", "calculations", ".", "Another", "major", "problem", "revolves", "around", "the", "inefficient", "contact", "of", "the", "reservoir", "fluid", "with", "the", "displacing", "fluid", "because", "of", "channeling", "and", "frontal", "instabilities", "known", "as", "fingering", ".", "We", "must", "be", "able", "to", "predict", "accurately", "fluid", "channeling", "and", "fingering", "and", "develop", "techniques", "to", "alleviate", "such", "problems", ".", "The", "recognition", "and", "prediction", "of", "flow", "channeling", "can", "be", "accomplished", "from", "the", "analysis", "of", "the", "reservoir", "rock", ",", "fluid", "properties", ",", "water", "/", "oil", "and", "gas", "/", "oil", "ratios", ",", "tracer", "signature", ",", "and", "pressure", "-", "transient", "response", ".", "Practical", "reservoir", "simulators", "are", "based", "on", "finite", "-", "difference", "and", "finite", "-", "element", "discretization", "schemes", ".", "I", "do", "not", "anticipate", "any", "major", "changes", "in", "these", "numerical", "approaches", "in", "the", "foreseeable", "future", ".", "The", "research", "in", "this", "area", "must", "include", "judicious", "and", "efficient", "use", "of", "local", "mesh", "refinement", "to", "account", "for", "reservoir", "heterogeneities", "(", "channels", ",", "fractures", ",", "vugs", ",", "layers", ",", "and", "discontinuities", ")", ".", "Furthermore", ",", "we", "must", "learn", "to", "improve", "the", "mathematical", "implementation", "of", "the", "correct", "physics", "in", "such", "simulators", ".", "Finally", ",", "robust", "and", "efficient", "mathematical", "algorithms", "(", "e", ".", "g", ".", ",", "equation", "solvers", ",", "vapor", "/", "Iiquid", "equilibrium", "calculations", ",", "relative", "permeability", "hysteresis", "tracking", ")", "must", "be", "developed", "in", "anticipation", "of", "routinely", "using", "very", "large", "reservoir", "models", "with", "more", "than", "1", ",", "000", ",", "000", "nodes", ".", "I", "like", "to", "do", "research", "on", "various", "aspects", "of", "reservoir", "engineering", "(", "especially", "with", "a", "strong", "emphasis", "on", "the", "physics", "of", "flow", "in", "porous", "media", ")", ",", "reservoir", "description", ",", "and", "mathematical", "modeling", "(", "both", "analytical", "and", "numerical", ")", ".", "I", "want", "to", "work", "with", "students", "who", "are", "perceptive", ",", "have", "strong", "mathematical", "background", ",", "work", "hard", ",", "have", "self", "-", "initiative", ",", "and", "can", "transfer", "scientific", "ideas", "to", "practical", "applications", "."], "record": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_0> research interests <extra_id_5> Petroleum reservoir simulation , improved and enhanced oil recovery , transient testing in wells , and geomechanics simulation <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1>", "entity": [{"type": "research interests", "offset": [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17], "text": "Petroleum reservoir simulation , improved and enhanced oil recovery , transient testing in wells , and geomechanics simulation"}], "relation": [], "event": [], "spot": ["research interests"], "asoc": [], "spot_asoc": [{"span": "Petroleum reservoir simulation , improved and enhanced oil recovery , transient testing in wells , and geomechanics simulation", "label": "research interests", "asoc": []}]}

I am particularly interested in microprocessor architectures - with a focus on high performance , energy efficiency and reliability ( fault tolerance ) . When I joined IBM Research in May of 1983 , I was lucky enough to have the privilege of working on a pioneering RISC super scalar processor R&D project . The project was managed by Dr . Tilak Agerwala ( who retired from IBM in 2013 - as VP of Systems ) and mentored by IBM Fellow and ACM Turing Award winner , Dr . John Cocke . I was fortunate to start my career at IBM as one who was given the \" timer \" development job in that now - famous Cheetah / America RISC processor project . ( The term \" timer \" was an IBM term that referred to a cycle - accurate simulator ) . This role allowed me to develop a deep understanding of how : ( a ) processor microarchitectures were implemented ; ( b ) how to optimize the super scalar pipelines for performance ; and ( c ) how to leverage compiler optimizations to extract performance from super scalar processors . Later , I worked on performance optimizations related to IBM ' s mainframe processors - in particular the IBM S / 390 VF ( vector facility ) .

{"text": "Professor Peter Gluckmans research focuses on what gives us a healthy start to life : understanding how a babys environment between conception and birth determines its childhood development and life - long health - and the impact that this knowledge has for individuals and whole populations . His research has won him numerous awards and international recognition including Fellowship of the Commonwealths most prestigious scientific organisation , The Royal Society ( London ) . He is the only New Zealander elected to the Institute of Medicine of the National Academies of Science ( USA ) and the Academy of Medical Sciences of Great Britain . In 2009 he became a Knight of the New Zealand Order of Merit replacing the 2008 Distinguished Companion of the NZ Order of Merit , for services to medicine and having previously been made a Companion of the Order in 1997 . In 2001 he received New Zealands top science award , the Rutherford Medal . He resigned from his directorships of the Liggins Institute and the National Research Centre of Growth and Development ( NRCGD ) ( now Gravida ) to avoid potential conflicts of interest in taking up his part time appointment as the first Chief Science Advisor to the Prime Minister of New Zealand from 01 July 2009 . He continues to be based in the Liggins Institute as an active researcher and member of the Institute . A University of Auckland Distinguished Professor , he is Professor of Paediatric and Perinatal Biology . He was formerly Chairman of the Department of Paediatrics and Dean of the Faculty of Medical and Health Sciences for nine years . He has been extensively involved in many aspects of science , health and educational policy development . Professor Gluckman is an international advocate for science , promoting the translation of discoveries in biomedical research into improvements in long term health outcomes . His work with organisations such as the WHO has brought growing recognition of the importance of a healthy start to life . He is the author of over 500 scientific papers and reviews and editor of eight books , including two influential textbooks in his subject area . He is passionate about communicating a better understanding of science in the community and , with colleague Mark Hanson of The University of Southampton , has co - authored two books for non - scientific audiences : The Fetal Matrix ( 2004 ) which summarises his ideas on how events in early life lead to altered disease risk in later life and Mismatch - why our world no longer fits our bodies ( 2006 ) . Mismatch explains how our efforts to make our lives more comfortable have , in fact , worked against us and that many of our current social and health problems - such as the current obesity epidemic , and its consequences including diabetes and heart disease , are the result of our bodies not keeping pace with the rate at which we have redesigned the world we now inhabit . With Hanson and Dr Alan Beedle he is co - author of the first text book and organised summary of evolutionary medicine Principles of Evolutionary Medicine ( Oxford University Press , 2009 ) , published 200 years after Charles Darwin ' s birth .", "tokens": ["Professor", "Peter", "Gluckmans", "research", "focuses", "on", "what", "gives", "us", "a", "healthy", "start", "to", "life", ":",

{"text": "George William Gray CBE , FRS ( 4 September 1926 12 May 2013 ) [ 1 ] was a Professor of Organic Chemistry at the University of Hull and was instrumental in developing the long - lasting materials which made liquid crystal displays possible . He created and systematised the liquid crystal materials science , and established a method of practical molecular design . Born in Denny , Scotland , [ 3 ] Gray was educated at the University of Glasgow and while working as an assistant lecturer at the University College in Hull ( then part of the University of London ) obtained his PhD in 1953 . [ 4 ] He developed his academic career at the college , which became the University of Hull in 1954 , from 1946 to 1990 . He was appointed senior lecturer in 1960 , Professor of Organic Chemistry in 1974 , and GF Grant Professor of Chemistry in 1984 . [ 4 ] He remained an Emeritus Professor at Hull . [ 5 ] In 1990 he joined the chemical company Merck , then become an independent consultant in 1996 . In 1973 , in conjunction with the Royal Radar Establishment , he showed that 4 - Cyano - 4 ' - pentylbiphenyl possessed a stable nematic phase at room temperature . [ 6 ] This compound and other long - lasting cyano - biphenyls made the twisted nematic display ( LCD ) popular . Gray wrote the first English book covering the subject of liquid crystals , \" Molecular Structure and Properties of Liquid Crystals \" , published in 1962 . [ 7 ] Gray was recipient of the 1995 Kyoto Prize for Advanced Technology and was made a Commander of the Order of the British Empire ( CBE ) in 1991 . He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1983 , and in 1987 was awarded the Leverhulme Medal of the Royal Society . In 1979 he was awarded the Rank Prize for Opto - electronics and in 1996 the SID Karl Ferdinand Braun Prize . The University of Hull was the first university to be awarded the Queen ' s Award for Technological Achievement , in 1979 , for the liquid crystal joint - development work . [ 5 ] Gray has been a Director of the International Liquid Crystal Society . Members of the British Liquid Crystal Society honoured his achievements by establishing the George W . Gray Medal for contributions to liquid crystal research and technology . [ 8 ] In March 2013 , the University of Hull celebrated the 40th anniversary of Gray ' s seminal paper being published on 22 March 1973 .

He is the current IEEE Computer Society Vice President for Professional Activities , and has served as Second Vice President , Electronic Products and Services ; Vice President for Standards Activities ; and as a member of the Board of Governors . He served as an Executive Editor of the Society ' s Guide to the Software Engineering Body of Knowledge and a member of the Editorial Board of the recent revision of the Encyclopedia of Software Engineering . He performs software and systems engineering standardization for the IEEE , serving as its liaison to ISO / IEC JTC 1 / SC 7 and as a member of the Executive Committee of the IEEE Software and Systems Engineering Standards Committee . The IEEE Computer Society has recognized him as a Charter Member of their Golden Core ; the IEEE selected him as a recipient of their Third Millennium . In 2006 , IEEE designated Mr . Moore as a Fellow citing his leadership in software engineering standardization and contributions to the codification of software engineering . In 2007 , he received the IEEE Standards Association ' s 2007 International Award for his \" considerable contribution to the IEEE Computer Society Software and Systems Engineering Standards Collection ( S2ESC ) and the international collection of software engineering standards supported by ISO / IEC \" . His latest book on software engineering standards was published in 2006 by John Wiley & Son . He holds two US patents and , dating to times when software was not regarded as patentable , two \" defensive publications \" . James Moore PlaqueIn 23 years of service to the IEEE Computer Society and the IEEE Standards Association , Moore has pursued the application of engineering principles to modern information technology and software problems , providing key contributions to the standards for POSIX and Ada . In 1995 , he began working on the craft - based techniques of software development , taking on the job of \" harmonizing \" the inconsistent standards of ISO / IEC and IEEE on the subjecta program which is close to completion . In 1997 , he began working with others in developing an engineering - based codification of software development , resulting in a cornerstone for the discipline , the 2004 Guide to the Software Engineering Body of Knowledge . As Chair of the IEEE Computer Society ' s Professional Practices Committee , he led efforts to align the SWEBOK Guide with the model curriculum for software engineering and with the Computer Society ' s two certification programs , resulting in a single statement of the content and boundaries of the software engineering disciplinea baseline which has been largely accepted by external groups developing a master ' s level curriculum in software engineering and providing a path to licensure in the United States of software engineers .", "tokens": ["James", "W", ".", "Moore", "is", "a",

{"text": "Professor Susanne von Caemmerer is the Centre Deputy Director and co - leader of Research Program 1 . Her research spans projects in Programs 1 , 2 , 3 and 4 being focussed on understanding and improving C4 photosynthesis , genetically manipulating the photosynthetic electron transport chain , and developing better leaf and plant photosynthetic models . Susannes research has focused on the gas exchange of leaves , the biochemistry of CO2 fixation and the regulation of CO2 and water vapour diffusion in species with C3 , C4 or CAM photosynthetic pathways . Originally trained in pure mathematics , she worked across scales in biochemistry , molecular biology and whole plant physiology combining mathematical modelling approaches with experimental verification . Currently she is working on photosynthesis and stomatal function , with an emphasis on the mathematical modelling of the carbon acquisition of plants , the biochemistry of carbon dioxide fixation and regulation of carbon dioxide diffusion in leaves . Susanne obtained her BA ( Honours ) in Pure Mathematics in 1976 at the Australian National University ( ANU ) and her PhD in Plant Physiology in 1981 , also at ANU . She is internationally renowned for her research on photosynthetic modelling , analysis of photosynthesis and stomatal function by genetic manipulation , and stable isotope fractionation in plants . She was elected to the German Academy of Science Leopoldina in 2006 and as a fellow of the Australian Academy of Science in the same year . She is also a member of the C4 Rice Consortium , a group multidisciplinary scientist from around the world working together to discover genes that will supercharge photosynthesis in rice to boost food production in the developing world . Susanne won the prestigious Charles F . Kettering award by the American Society of Plant Biologists in 2014 . Susanne von Caemmerer co - developed what is arguably the most widely used biochemical model in plant biology the Farquhar , von Caemmerer and Berry model of C3 photosynthesis . She then went on to develop an equally widely used model of C4 photosynthesis . She resolved the long debated and critical question of why there is so much Rubisco by showing that under high - light Rubisco exerts very strong metabolic control in both C3 and C4 plants and therefore is not in excess . Most recently she has led the way toward resolving anomalies around the critical issue of mesophyll conductance .", "tokens": ["Professor", "Susanne", "von", "Caemmerer", "is", "the", "Centre",

Frank ' s laboratory revolves around effector mechanisms of immune damage . Specifically , the laboratory is interested in understanding how antibody and complement contribute to the damage of tissues and micro - organisms . Overlapping areas of interest include the role of mediators in inflammation and the functions of antibody and complement in the production of autoimmune disease . Specific interests of the group in the last year have included studies of the mechanism by which infusion of intravenous immunoglobulin into animals and man down regulates immunologic damage . A second area of interest concerns the role of complement and antibody in the pathogenesis of HIV and in prevention of HIV infection . A third area concerns the role of complement in the generation of an immune response .

{"text": "Chan is Chair Professor of the Graduate Institute of Network Learning Technology at National Central University in Taiwan . He has worked on various areas of digital technology supported learning , including artificial intelligence in education , computer supported collaborative learning , digital classrooms , online learning communities , mobile and ubiquitous learning , digital game based learning , and , most recently , technology supported mathematics and language arts learning . In 1988 , Chan produced his doctoral thesis , a seminal work in artificial intelligence in education , proposing the concept of virtual learning companion a learning environment consisting of multiple virtual characters , such as a learning companion and a tutor . An environment with learning companions can provide a rich social context , allowing students to interact in diverse social activities including collaborative learning . The field of learning companion research is currently an active sub - area of artificial intelligence in education . Upon conferral of his PhD , Chan worked with colleagues to connect two IBM PC compatible personal computers via cable . Shortly thereafter , they put their efforts towards constructing a networked learning system comprised of tens of personal computers , thus creating an experimental research laboratory . In 1992 , they published their work on this system , which they called a futuristic intelligent classroom . It was probably the first dedicated , synchronous , networked learning system in the world for collaborative learning and competitive learning games . Following those initial efforts , Chan and his colleagues continued to conduct a series of synchronous networked learning research via connected computers in classrooms through the nineties . Then , in 1999 , with the realization that laptops were far too expensive and personal computers were still too bulky for the classroom , Chan , along with colleagues , developed an inexpensive wireless response clicker system called EduClick for enhancing teacher - student interactions in question - and - answer activities . He later found that he was not the first one to conceive of the design of such a clicker , but he was surprised by the swelling popularity of such clickers in classrooms over the world .", "tokens":

{"text": "Born in 1968 , graduated at Pavia with a thesis on photo - Single Electron Transfer ( SET ) induced carbon - carbon bond forming reactions . During his PhD he joined the group of Prof . Mattay at the University of Mnster ( Germany ) working on the synthetic applications of the photoinduced reductive cyclization of - cyclopropylketones . In 1996 he obtained a fellowship from the \" Istituto Superiore della Sanit \" for the study of the photostability of drugs . He is currently an Associate Professor of the Department of Chemistry at the University of Pavia . He is interested on the generation of reactive intermediates e . g . radicals and cations and radical ions by photochemical means . In the last years he became interested in photoinduced radical alkylations and in the generation and reactivity of aryl cations . Particular attention has been given to the significance of such mild synthetic procedures in the frame of the increasing interest for sustainable / green chemistry . He has been recently involved in the application of ionic liquids both in organic synthesis and in lithium batteries and in the functionalization and ensuing application of carbon nanotubes . He is currently a member of the committee of the Italian group of Photochemistry . He is coauthor of 140 publications on international journals including 14 chapters on various aspects of organic photochemistry . He was also co - editor of the book \" Handbook of Synthetic Photochemistry \" ( 2010 ) . In 2011 he was recipient of the CINMPIS prize for \" Innovation in organic synthesis \" and of the \" Exploration of new research frontiers Award \" from Cariplo Foundation .

{"text": "Professor Golds academic interests include neurobiology of memory and neural plasticity , with a focus on aging and Alzheimers Disease . Professor Golds research crosses several levels of analysis , including cellular analyses of the mechanisms by which stress and arousal - related hormones and neurotransmitters regulate memory formation , systems analyses of neurochemical regulation of learning and memory , and drug enhancement of memory in laboratory rodents and in humans . His research includes demonstrations of robust enhancement of memory with pharmacological treatments in healthy aged people and in people with Alzheimers Disease , Down syndrome and traumatic brain injury . He continues to investigate the bases for memory loss and reversal of that loss in aged rodents , including mouse and rat models of Alzheimers Disease and Down syndrome . Much of his current research is centered on the role of glial cells in regulating energy metabolism in the brain to promote memory processing . He has published over 200 articles and chapters and has had continuous NIH and NSF funding for over 40 years . From 1976 - 1999 , Dr . Gold was at the University of Virginia , where he was Director of the Neuroscience Program and was a Chaired Professor . From 1998 - 1999 , Professor Gold served as a member of Governors Commission on Alzheimers Disease and Related Disorders for the Commonwealth of Virginia . He is the recipient of a Distinguished Alumnus Award from the Department of Psychology at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill , the James Flood Memorial Distinguished Lectureship at St . Louis University , and was named Master Lecturer by the American Psychological Association . He is a fellow of the American Psychological Association , the American Psychological Society , and American Association for the Advancement of Science . From 1998 - 2011 , Dr .

{"text": "avid J . Brown is an American computer scientist . He was one of a small group that helped to develop the system at Stanford that later resulted in Sun Microsystems , and later was a founder Silicon Graphics in 1982 . Brown received his primary and secondary school education in New York , and then studied at the University of Pennsylvania , Moore School of Electrical Engineering where he received a B . S . E . in 1979 and an M . S . E under the tutelage of Ruzena Bajcsy in 1980 . In 1984 , Brown was introduced to David Wheeler , who invited him to join the University of Cambridge Computer Laboratory as a doctoral candidate . In October 1986 , he matriculated at St John ' s College , University of Cambridge , England to pursue a Ph . D . His dissertation introduced the concept of Unified Memory Architecture . [ 1 ] This idea has subsequently been widely applied most notably by Intel in their processors and platform architecture of the late 1990s and onward . Brown became a member of the research staff in the Computer Science Department at Stanford University in 1981 , where he helped develop the research edition of the SUN workstation with Andreas Bechtolsheim , prior to the establishment of Sun Microsystems . [ 2 ] In 1982 , Brown was one of the group of the seven technical staff from Stanford ( along with Kurt Akeley , Tom Davis , Rocky Rhodes , Mark Hannah , Mark Grossman , Charles \" Herb \" Kuta ) who joined Jim Clark to form Silicon Graphics . [ 3 ] [ 4 ] Brown and Stephen R . Bourne formed the Workstation Systems Engineering group at Digital Equipment Corporation . Together they built the group responsible for the introduction of the DECstation line of computer systems . [ 5 ] In 1992 , Brown joined Sun Microsystems . He helped establish the process used for the company ' s system software architecture , and then went on to define the application binary interface [ 2 ] for Solaris , Sun ' s principal system software product . Later , Brown worked on Solaris ' s adoption of Open Source software and practices , and then its technologies for energy - efficient computing .

William Wager Cooper was born on July 23 , 1914 , in Birmingham , Alabama . He grew up in Chicago , where his father ( a former bookkeeper ) owned several gasoline stations that closed in the Great Depression . Cooper , in his second year of high school , dropped out to help support his family . He worked in a bowling alley , on a golf course , and as a professional boxer ; . As a boxer , he won 58 bouts , lost three , and drew two . While commuting to the golf course , he met Eric Kohler , a professor at Northwestern University , who pushed him to go back to school and bankrolled his entry to the University of Chicago . At Chicago , he began studying physical chemistry but was inspired by his work for Kohler on a legal case to switch to economics , graduating with a B . A . and Phi Beta Kappa honors in 1938 . After graduation , from 1938 to 1940 , he worked as an accountant for the Tennessee Valley Authority , where Kohler had become Controller . There , he worked on performance auditing and the mathematical allocation of resources , and helped Kohler testify to a congressional investigative committee . In 1940 , Cooper started doing graduate studies at Columbia University ; however , in 1942 , with his coursework completed but his thesis unwritten , he left Columbia to serve his country during World War II . He worked in the Division of Statistical Standards of the U . S . Bureau of the Budget coordinating the government programs that collected accounting statistics ; his 1945 paper describing his wartime activities was the first recipient of an award from the American Institute of Accountants for the best paper of the year .", "tokens": ["William", "Wager", "Cooper", "(", "July", "23", ",", "1914", "June", "20", ",", "2012", ")", "was", "an", "American", "operations", "researcher", ",", "known", "as", "a", "father", "of", "management", "science", "and", "as", "\"", "Mr", ".", "Linear", "Programming", "\"", ".", "He", "was", "the", "founding", "president", "of", "The", "Institute", "of", "Management", "Sciences", ",", "founding", "editor", "-", "in", "-", "chief", "of", "Auditing", ":", "A", "Journal", "of", "Practice", "and", "Theory", ",", "a", "founding", "faculty", "member", "of", "the", "Graduate", "School", "of", "Industrial", "Administration", "at", "the", "Carnegie", "Institute", "of", "Technology", "(", "now", "the", "Tepper", "School", "of", "Business", "at", "Carnegie", "Mellon", "University", ")", ",", "founding", "dean", "of", "the", "School", "of", "Urban", "and", "Public", "Affairs", "(", "now", "the", "Heinz", "College", ")", "at", "CMU", ",", "the", "former", "Arthur", "Lowes", "Dickinson", "Professor", "of", "Accounting", "at", "Harvard", "University", ",", "and", "the", "Foster", "Parker", "Professor", "Emeritus", "of", "Management", ",", "Finance", "and", "Accounting", "at", "the", "University", "of", "Texas", "at", "Austin", ".", "William", "Wager", "Cooper", "was", "born", "on", "July", "23", ",", "1914", ",", "in", "Birmingham", ",", "Alabama", ".", "He", "grew", "up", "in", "Chicago", ",", "where", "his", "father", "(", "a", "former", "bookkeeper", ")", "owned", "several", "gasoline", "stations", "that", "closed", "in", "the", "Great", "Depression", ".", "Cooper", ",", "in", "his", "second", "year", "of", "high", "school", ",", "dropped", "out", "to", "help", "support", "his", "family", ".", "He", "worked", "in", "a", "bowling", "alley", ",", "on", "a", "golf", "course", ",", "and", "as", "a", "professional", "boxer", ";", ".", "As", "a", "boxer", ",", "he", "won", "58", "bouts", ",", "lost", "three", ",", "and", "drew", "two", ".", "While", "commuting", "to", "the", "golf", "course", ",", "he", "met", "Eric", "Kohler", ",", "a", "professor", "at", "Northwestern", "University", ",", "who", "pushed", "him", "to", "go", "back", "to", "school", "and", "bankrolled", "his", "entry", "to", "the", "University", "of", "Chicago", ".", "At", "Chicago", ",", "he", "began", "studying", "physical", "chemistry", "but", "was", "inspired", "by", "his", "work", "for", "Kohler", "on", "a", "legal", "case", "to", "switch", "to", "economics", ",", "graduating", "with", "a", "B", ".", "A", ".", "and", "Phi", "Beta", "Kappa", "honors", "in", "1938", ".", "After", "graduation", ",", "from", "1938", "to", "1940", ",", "he", "worked", "as", "an", "accountant", "for", "the", "Tennessee", "Valley", "Authority", ",", "where", "Kohler", "had", "become", "Controller", ".", "There", ",", "he", "worked", "on", "performance", "auditing", "and", "the", "mathematical", "allocation", "of", "resources", ",", "and", "helped", "Kohler", "testify", "to", "a", "congressional", "investigative", "committee", ".", "In", "1940", ",", "Cooper", "started", "doing", "graduate", "studies", "at", "Columbia", "University", ";", "however", ",", "in", "1942", ",", "with", "his", "coursework", "completed", "but", "his", "thesis", "unwritten", ",", "he", "left", "Columbia", "to", "serve", "his", "country", "during", "World", "War", "II", ".", "He", "worked", "in", "the", "Division", "of", "Statistical", "Standards", "of", "the", "U", ".", "S", ".", "Bureau", "of", "the", "Budget", "coordinating", "the", "government", "programs", "that", "collected", "accounting", "statistics", ";", "his", "1945", "paper", "describing", "his", "wartime", "activities", "was", "the", "first", "recipient", "of", "an", "award", "from", "the", "American", "Institute", "of", "Accountants", "for", "the", "best", "paper", "of", "the", "year", "."], "record": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_0> birthday <extra_id_5> July 23 , 1914 <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> honorary title <extra_id_5> Mr .

{"text": "Walter Fiers ( born 1931 in Ypres , West Flanders ) is a Belgian molecular biologist . He obtained a degree of Engineer for Chemistry and Agricultural Industries at the University of Ghent in 1954 , and started his research career as an enzymologist in the laboratory of Laurent Vandendriessche in Ghent . In 1956 - 57 , he worked with Heinz Holter in Copenhagen ( Denmark ) . In 1960 , he obtained a fellowship from the Rockefeller Foundation and joined the group of Bob Sinsheimer as a postdoc . At the California Institute of Technology Walter Fiers was exposed to Molecular Biology , which was then just developing , studying viral DNA . He demonstrated the physical , covalently closed circularity of Bacteriophage PhiX - 174 DNA . In 1962 , Fiers moved to Madison , Wisconsin , to work in the laboratory of future Nobel laureate , Gobind Khorana . At the end of 1962 , Fiers returned to Belgium and set up the Laboratory of Molecular Biology at the University of Ghent . His research involved Bacteriophage MS2 ; he was the first to establish the complete nucleotide sequence of a gene ( 1972 ) and of a viral genome ( bacteriophage MS2 ) ( 1976 ) . In 1978 Fiers and his team were the first to reveal the complete nucleotide - sequence of SV40 . The development of totally new procedures and knowledge led to the ability to clone almost any gene and to express these efficiently in bacteria or in other heterologous hosts . In 1997 Fiers retired and became Professor Emeritus , and the following year he retired from his position as director of the Laboratory of Molecular Biology . Together with Xavier Saelens and their team , he continued his research , to find a universal influenza vaccine , based on the M2 protein on the surface of the influenza A virus . The ectodomain of the M2 protein remains unchanged in all human influenza viruses known , including the strains that caused the pandemics in the last century , which makes it eligible for a universal influenza A vaccine .", "tokens": ["Walter", "Fiers", "(", "born", "1931", "in", "Ypres", ",", "West", "Flanders", ")", "is", "a", "Belgian", "molecular", "biologist", ".", "He", "obtained", "a", "degree", "of", "Engineer", "for", "Chemistry", "and", "Agricultural", "Industries", "at", "the", "University", "of", "Ghent", "in", "1954", ",", "and", "started", "his", "research", "career", "as", "an", "enzymologist", "in", "the", "laboratory", "of", "Laurent", "Vandendriessche", "in", "Ghent", ".", "In", "1956", "-", "57", ",", "he", "worked", "with", "Heinz", "Holter", "in", "Copenhagen", "(", "Denmark", ")", ".", "In", "1960", ",", "he", "obtained", "a", "fellowship", "from", "the", "Rockefeller", "Foundation", "and", "joined", "the", "group", "of", "Bob", "Sinsheimer", "as", "a", "postdoc", ".", "At", "the", "California", "Institute", "of", "Technology", "Walter", "Fiers", "was", "exposed", "to", "Molecular", "Biology", ",", "which", "was", "then", "just", "developing", ",", "studying", "viral", "DNA", ".", "He", "demonstrated", "the", "physical", ",", "covalently", "closed", "circularity", "of", "Bacteriophage", "PhiX", "-", "174", "DNA", ".", "In", "1962", ",", "Fiers", "moved", "to", "Madison", ",", "Wisconsin", ",", "to", "work", "in", "the", "laboratory", "of", "future", "Nobel", "laureate", ",", "Gobind", "Khorana", ".", "At", "the", "end", "of", "1962", ",", "Fiers", "returned", "to", "Belgium", "and", "set", "up", "the", "Laboratory", "of", "Molecular", "Biology", "at", "the", "University", "of", "Ghent", ".", "His", "research", "involved", "Bacteriophage", "MS2", ";", "he", "was", "the", "first", "to", "establish", "the", "complete", "nucleotide", "sequence", "of", "a", "gene", "(", "1972", ")", "and", "of", "a", "viral", "genome", "(", "bacteriophage", "MS2", ")", "(", "1976", ")", ".", "In", "1978", "Fiers", "and", "his", "team", "were", "the", "first", "to", "reveal", "the", "complete", "nucleotide", "-", "sequence", "of", "SV40", ".", "The", "development", "of", "totally", "new", "procedures", "and", "knowledge", "led", "to", "the", "ability", "to", "clone", "almost", "any", "gene", "and", "to", "express", "these", "efficiently", "in", "bacteria", "or", "in", "other", "heterologous", "hosts", ".", "In", "1997", "Fiers", "retired", "and", "became", "Professor", "Emeritus", ",", "and", "the", "following", "year", "he", "retired", "from", "his", "position", "as", "director", "of", "the", "Laboratory", "of", "Molecular", "Biology", ".", "Together", "with", "Xavier", "Saelens", "and", "their", "team", ",", "he", "continued", "his", "research", ",", "to", "find", "a", "universal", "influenza", "vaccine", ",", "based", "on", "the", "M2", "protein", "on", "the", "surface", "of", "the", "influenza", "A", "virus", ".", "The", "ectodomain", "of", "the", "M2", "protein", "remains", "unchanged", "in", "all", "human", "influenza", "viruses", "known", ",", "including", "the", "strains", "that", "caused", "the", "pandemics", "in", "the", "last", "century", ",", "which", "makes", "it", "eligible", "for", "a", "universal", "influenza", "A", "vaccine", "."], "record": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_0> birthday <extra_id_5> 1931 <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> birth place <extra_id_5> Ypres , West Flanders <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> gender <extra_id_5> He <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> education <extra_id_5> He obtained a degree of Engineer for Chemistry and Agricultural Industries at the University of Ghent in 1954 <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> work record <extra_id_5> started his research career as an enzymologist in the laboratory of Laurent Vandendriessche in Ghent .

{"text": "Dr . Misztal has had a keen interest in the computing aspects of animal breeding research and has worked with supercomputers , parallel processing , and Fortran 90 . His general research goal has been to develop efficient computing algorithms for the problems of prediction and estimation of breeding values . Since 1985 , the animal model was emerging as the model of choice for genetic evaluation systems , and algorithms for solving mixed model equations and estimating genetic parameters were very expensive and usually inadequate for large data sets . He developed a popular general purpose program ( JAA ) which used second order Jacobi iteration , required less disk space , and was very simple compared to other algorithms at the time . From this he developed algorithms for approximating the reliabilities of genetic evaluations . His experience in Illinois led him to study algorithms for threshold models ( for categorical data ) . Sparse matrix factorization was applied to DF - REML estimation of variance components which reduced computations by an order of 3 fold . He presented an invited paper at a symposium on Continuous Genetic Evaluations in which he proposed that genetic evaluations could be updated continuously rather than only twice per year . However , the real world was not ready for sire proofs to change that frequently . He developed a multiple trait genetic evaluation system for conformation traits for the Holstein Association . He also developed methodology for including dominance genetic effects into national genetic evaluations , and showed that ignoring dominance genetic effects could seriously bias the evaluations , particularly of young bull dams . Dr . Misztal is currently working on mating systems that account for inbreeding and dominance . He has started a very interesting research program in looking at heat stress in dairy cattle using data from public weather stations and how heat may affect production . He has started a comparison of different crossbreeding theories to derive exact covariances between purebreds and crossbreds . Below is a list of software that he has developed and provides free of charge . He has given many courses on computing aspects in animal breeding to different institutions around the world including Japan , China , Bolivia , Brazil , Czech Republic , the Netherlands , Finland , Poland , Belgium , Argentina , Russia , and several places within the United States . Dr . Misztal is a very logical and detailed thinker , with a mind like a computer one might say . His programs are distributed around the world and have contributed to many different research projects .", "tokens": ["Dr", ".", "Misztal", "has", "had", "a", "keen", "interest", "in", "the",

{"text": "My research uses fMRI and other technologies to uncover the structure of human thought . The fMRI studies track the brain activity that occurs during a wide range of cognitive and social thought , such as language comprehension , visual thinking , problem - solving , working memory , social judgment , and multi - tasking . One current interest is in identifying the neural basis of concept representations using fMRI in the new area of neurosemantics . In collaboration with colleagues in the School of Computer Science , we have developed experimental paradigms and machine - learning techniques ( multi - voxel pattern analysis ) that are being applied to the study of lexical , perceptual , and social concepts ( identifying the neural signature of that object and the components of the signature ) . We can identify the thought of a concrete object , social interaction , and digit , and we are moving on to propositions . This is leading us to a specification of how simple thoughts are neurally coded . A second research area examines how scientific concepts are learned . As we listen to a lecture or read a textbook , neural representations of the new knowledge are being established . We hope to specify the processes by which new concepts come to be neurally represented . Another important area of our research is in understanding the brain functioning in autism and relating it to the social and cognitive impairments that sometimes arise in the disorder . Our work has led to a new perspective , expressed as the underconnectivity theory of autism . This work uses fMRI and high angular resolution diffusion imaging ( HARDI ) to relate several levels of analysis : anatomical connectivity , informational ( functional ) connectivity , and behavioral performance . We are also starting to apply our neurosemantics ( machine learning ) methods to concept representations in autism . The findings are being used to continuously develop a comprehensive theory of how brain function is related to thought , often expressed in terms of the 4CAPS computational theory .

I have used insights gained as a diagnostic pathologist in viewing under the microscope the different cells and structures within the tumor microenvironment to generate testable hypotheses concerning the mechanisms which govern these steps of tumor progression . I was initially intrigued by the processes of stromal invasion and studied its regulation by myoepithelial cells , natural tumor suppressors that synthesize a basement membrane . I was then intrigued by the lymphovascular tumor embolus and lymphovascular invasion . I elected to study inflammatory breast cancer ( IBC ) as a model disease that epitomizes this route of metastasis . I developed the first xenograft model of inflammatory breast cancer , termed MARY - X that retains its biological signature of lymphovascular invasion . I also developed novel ways to access the breast through medical devices . As both a diagnostic as well as experimental pathologist , I became interested in objectifying ways to mine tissue for information through virtual digital pathology algorithms and related hardware . All these approaches continue to validate my belief that the tissue is still the issue .", "tokens": ["Dr", ".", "Barsky", "has", "previously", "served", "as", "member", "and", "Section", "Director",

{"text": "Research Research Summary / Interests I have had four primary areas of research during my career at the University of Minnesota . Exercise physiology of cardiac malformations . This involved studying children during cardiac catheterization with specific anomalies . We performed various measurements at both resting and during six minute exercise using a bicycle ergometer . We assessed the changes which occurred with exercise and compared the data to normal exercise responses . Long - term follow - up of patients with congenital heart disease . Since the first operations of children with congenital heart disease were performed , I have had a unique opportunity to assess the status of these patients after a number of years , now over 60 years in some instances . We have followed about 1 , 500 patients by correspondence or telephone in our studies , including one with 99 . 2% follow - up of 1 , 000 patients at 50 years . Cardiac pathology . During my fellowship , I spent one year with Dr . Jesse E . Edwards , a renowned cardiac pathologist and another year as a Research Associate . Subsequently , I worked with him on many occasions studying specimens of congenital anomalies . I have maintained that interest to the present and do some work in the Edwards Registry of Cardiovascular Diseases . Pediatric Cardiac Care Consortium . I created and directed the Consortium for 27 years . The purpose of the Consortium was to assess the care and outcomes of cardiac operations and interventional techniques in children with congenital or acquired cardiac disease . We recruited cardiac centers to participate in the program and eventually had 52 centers involved . The centers submitted to our office defined information on each patient undergoing a cardiac catheterization or cardiac operations they performed . Annually , we prepared reports for each center statistically comparing their experience and results to the group of centers . Over the 27 years , we obtained data on 135 , 000 children , which represented the largest data base in the US . Over the 27 years , the operative mortality rates decreased for each category of cardiac anomaly and centers used the data to improve their outcomes .", "tokens": ["Research", "Research", "Summary", "/", "Interests", "I", "have", "had", "four", "primary", "areas", "of", "research", "during", "my", "career", "at", "the", "University", "of", "Minnesota", ".", "Exercise", "physiology", "of", "cardiac", "malformations", ".", "This", "involved", "studying", "children", "during", "cardiac", "catheterization", "with", "specific", "anomalies", ".", "We", "performed", "various", "measurements", "at", "both", "resting", "and", "during", "six", "minute", "exercise", "using", "a", "bicycle", "ergometer", ".", "We", "assessed", "the", "changes", "which", "occurred", "with", "exercise", "and", "compared", "the", "data", "to", "normal", "exercise", "responses", ".", "Long", "-", "term", "follow", "-", "up", "of", "patients", "with", "congenital", "heart", "disease", ".", "Since", "the", "first", "operations", "of", "children", "with", "congenital", "heart", "disease", "were", "performed", ",", "I", "have", "had", "a", "unique", "opportunity", "to", "assess", "the", "status", "of", "these", "patients", "after", "a", "number", "of", "years", ",", "now", "over", "60", "years", "in", "some", "instances", ".", "We", "have", "followed", "about", "1", ",", "500", "patients", "by", "correspondence", "or", "telephone", "in", "our", "studies", ",", "including", "one", "with", "99", ".", "2%", "follow", "-", "up", "of", "1", ",", "000", "patients", "at", "50", "years", ".", "Cardiac", "pathology", ".", "During", "my", "fellowship", ",", "I", "spent", "one", "year", "with", "Dr", ".", "Jesse", "E", ".", "Edwards", ",", "a", "renowned", "cardiac", "pathologist", "and", "another", "year", "as", "a", "Research", "Associate", ".", "Subsequently", ",", "I", "worked", "with", "him", "on", "many", "occasions", "studying", "specimens", "of", "congenital", "anomalies", ".", "I", "have", "maintained", "that", "interest", "to", "the", "present", "and", "do", "some", "work", "in", "the", "Edwards", "Registry", "of", "Cardiovascular", "Diseases", ".", "Pediatric", "Cardiac", "Care", "Consortium", ".", "I", "created", "and", "directed", "the", "Consortium", "for", "27", "years", ".", "The", "purpose", "of", "the", "Consortium", "was", "to", "assess", "the", "care", "and", "outcomes", "of", "cardiac", "operations", "and", "interventional", "techniques", "in", "children", "with", "congenital", "or", "acquired", "cardiac", "disease", ".", "We", "recruited", "cardiac", "centers", "to", "participate", "in", "the", "program", "and", "eventually", "had", "52", "centers", "involved", ".", "The", "centers", "submitted", "to", "our", "office", "defined", "information", "on", "each", "patient", "undergoing", "a", "cardiac", "catheterization", "or", "cardiac", "operations", "they", "performed", ".", "Annually", ",", "we", "prepared", "reports", "for", "each", "center", "statistically", "comparing", "their", "experience", "and", "results", "to", "the", "group", "of", "centers", ".", "Over", "the", "27", "years", ",", "we", "obtained", "data", "on", "135", ",", "000", "children", ",", "which", "represented", "the", "largest", "data", "base", "in", "the", "US", ".", "Over", "the", "27", "years", ",", "the", "operative", "mortality", "rates", "decreased", "for", "each", "category", "of", "cardiac", "anomaly", "and", "centers", "used", "the", "data", "to", "improve", "their", "outcomes", "."], "record": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_0> research interests <extra_id_5> Exercise physiology of cardiac malformations <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> research interests <extra_id_5> Long - term follow - up of patients with congenital heart disease <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> research interests <extra_id_5> Cardiac pathology <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> research interests <extra_id_5> Pediatric Cardiac Care Consortium <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1>", "entity": [{"type": "research interests", "offset": [22, 23, 24, 25, 26], "text": "Exercise physiology of cardiac malformations"}, {"type": "research interests", "offset": [73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84], "text": "Long - term follow - up of patients with congenital heart disease"}, {"type": "research interests", "offset": [160, 161], "text": "Cardiac pathology"}, {"type": "research interests", "offset": [226, 227, 228, 229], "text": "Pediatric Cardiac Care Consortium"}], "relation": [], "event": [], "spot": ["research interests"], "asoc": [], "spot_asoc": [{"span": "Exercise physiology of cardiac malformations", "label": "research interests", "asoc": []}, {"span": "Long - term follow - up of patients with congenital heart disease", "label": "research interests", "asoc": []}, {"span": "Cardiac pathology", "label": "research interests", "asoc": []}, {"span": "Pediatric Cardiac Care Consortium", "label": "research interests", "asoc": []}]}

He received the SIAM ' s John von Neumann prize in 1986 and numerous other distinctions . [ 1 ] [ 2 ] Lions is listed as an ISI highly cited researcher . After being part of the French Rsistance in 1943 and 1944 , J . - L . Lions entered the cole Normale Suprieure in 1947 . He was a professor of mathematics at the Universit of Nancy , the Faculty of Sciences of Paris , and the cole polytechnique . He joined the prestigious Collge de France as well as the French Academy of Sciences in 1973 . In 1979 , he was appointed director of the Institut National de la Recherche en Informatique et Automatique ( INRIA ) , where he taught and promoted the use of numerical simulations using finite elements integration . Throughout his career , Lions insisted on the use of mathematics in industry , with a particular involvement in the French space program , as well as in domains such as energy and the environment . This eventually led him to be appointed director of the Centre National d ' Etudes Spatiales ( CNES ) from 1984 to 1992 . Lions was elected President of the International Mathematical Union in 1991 and also received the Japan Prize and the Harvey Prize that same year . [ 2 ] In 1992 , the University of Houston awarded him an honorary doctoral degree . He was elected president of the French Academy of Sciences in 1996 and was also a Foreign Member of the Royal Society ( ForMemRS ) [ 4 ] and numerous other foreign academies . [ 1 ] [ 2 ] He has left a considerable body of work , among this more than 400 scientific articles , 20 volumes of mathematics that were translated into English and Russian , and major contributions to several collective works , including the 4000 pages of the monumental Mathematical analysis and numerical methods for science and technology ( in collaboration with Robert Dautray ) , as well as the Handbook of numerical analysis in 7 volumes ( with Philippe G . Ciarlet ) . His son Pierre - Louis Lions is also a well - known mathematician who was awarded a Fields Medal in 1994 .", "tokens": ["Jacques", "-", "Louis", "Lions", "(", "French", ":", "[", "lj", "]", ";", "3", "May", "1928", "17", "May", "2001", ")", "was", "a", "French", "mathematician", "who", "made", "contributions", "to", "the", "theory", "of", "partial", "differential", "equations", "and", "to", "stochastic", "control", ",", "among", "other", "areas", ".", "He", "received", "the", "SIAM", "'", "s", "John", "von", "Neumann", "prize", "in", "1986", "and", "numerous", "other", "distinctions", ".", "[", "1", "]", "[", "2", "]", "Lions", "is", "listed", "as", "an", "ISI", "highly", "cited", "researcher", ".", "After", "being", "part", "of", "the", "French", "Rsistance", "in", "1943", "and", "1944", ",", "J", ".", "-", "L", ".", "Lions", "entered", "the", "cole", "Normale", "Suprieure", "in", "1947", ".", "He", "was", "a", "professor", "of", "mathematics", "at", "the", "Universit", "of", "Nancy", ",", "the", "Faculty", "of", "Sciences", "of", "Paris", ",", "and", "the", "cole", "polytechnique", ".", "He", "joined", "the", "prestigious", "Collge", "de", "France", "as", "well", "as", "the", "French", "Academy", "of", "Sciences", "in", "1973", ".", "In", "1979", ",", "he", "was", "appointed", "director", "of", "the", "Institut", "National", "de", "la", "Recherche", "en", "Informatique", "et", "Automatique", "(", "INRIA", ")", ",", "where", "he", "taught", "and", "promoted", "the", "use", "of", "numerical", "simulations", "using", "finite", "elements", "integration", ".", "Throughout", "his", "career", ",", "Lions", "insisted", "on", "the", "use", "of", "mathematics", "in", "industry", ",", "with", "a", "particular", "involvement", "in", "the", "French", "space", "program", ",", "as", "well", "as", "in", "domains", "such", "as", "energy", "and", "the", "environment", ".", "This", "eventually", "led", "him", "to", "be", "appointed", "director", "of", "the", "Centre", "National", "d", "'", "Etudes", "Spatiales", "(", "CNES", ")", "from", "1984", "to", "1992", ".", "Lions", "was", "elected", "President", "of", "the", "International", "Mathematical", "Union", "in", "1991", "and", "also", "received", "the", "Japan", "Prize", "and", "the", "Harvey", "Prize", "that", "same", "year", ".", "[", "2", "]", "In", "1992", ",", "the", "University", "of", "Houston", "awarded", "him", "an", "honorary", "doctoral", "degree", ".", "He", "was", "elected", "president", "of", "the", "French", "Academy", "of", "Sciences", "in", "1996", "and", "was", "also", "a", "Foreign", "Member", "of", "the", "Royal", "Society", "(", "ForMemRS", ")", "[", "4", "]", "and", "numerous", "other", "foreign", "academies", ".", "[", "1", "]", "[", "2", "]", "He", "has", "left", "a", "considerable", "body", "of", "work", ",", "among", "this", "more", "than", "400", "scientific", "articles", ",", "20", "volumes", "of", "mathematics", "that", "were", "translated", "into", "English", "and", "Russian", ",", "and", "major", "contributions", "to", "several", "collective", "works", ",", "including", "the", "4000", "pages", "of", "the", "monumental", "Mathematical", "analysis", "and", "numerical", "methods", "for", "science", "and", "technology", "(", "in", "collaboration", "with", "Robert", "Dautray", ")", ",", "as", "well", "as", "the", "Handbook", "of", "numerical", "analysis", "in", "7", "volumes", "(", "with", "Philippe", "G", ".", "Ciarlet", ")", ".", "His", "son", "Pierre", "-", "Louis", "Lions", "is", "also", "a", "well", "-", "known", "mathematician", "who", "was", "awarded", "a", "Fields", "Medal", "in", "1994", "."], "record": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_0> birthday <extra_id_5> 3 May 1928 <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> gender <extra_id_5> He <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> awards <extra_id_5> the SIAM ' s John von Neumann prize <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> work record <extra_id_5> After being part of the French Rsistance in 1943 and 1944 , J . - L .

For the recent almost two decades in the U . S . , the research of mine has been focus on bioenergetics and breast cancer prevention , defining the cellular and molecular regulations and pathways that control nutrient uptake and energy balance during tumor growth / inhibition , including AMPK - associated energy sensor pathway and metabolic reprogramming , PI3K - Akt - mTOR , cell cycle , apoptotic cell death , angiogenesis , signal transduction and inflammation , along with a variety of strategies in cancer prevention using animal mammary tumorigenic model and clinical intervention trials for breast cancer . My dedication to mechanistic investigations and clinical cancer prevention research is demonstrated by 1 ) the unique path I have taken to reach my current professional position ; 2 ) my publications in the multiple areas including , but are not limited to : genetics , proteomics , endocrinology , and metabolomics ; 3 ) my successes in the multiple ( more than 10 ) projects that I have been involved as a principle investigator , co - principle investigator , or senior investigator , which were funded by the National Institute of Health ( NIH ) - National Cancer Institute ( NCI ) , the Department of Defense ( DOD ) , Susan G . Komen Foundation , and the American Institute for Cancer Research ( AICR ) ; 4 ) my active involvement in the peer reviews of manuscripts and grant applications as well as the scientific speech and consultant invited by scientific journals and foundations as well as conferences or institutes and companies not only in the U . S . but in China and Japan ; and 5 ) my international outreach in China ( Co - director of International Tea for Health Institute and Affiliated Teaching Professor ) and Japan .

{"text": "Robert L . Fleischer , 80 , of Schenectady , New York , died 3 March 2011 . Bob was well known for developing and applying the techniques used for nuclear - track etching . Born in Columbus , Ohio , he moved to Boston to attend Harvard University , where he received a PhD in applied physics . Following a time as assistant professor of metallurgy at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology , he moved to Schenectady and spent most of his career ( 32 years ) at General Electric ( GE ) Research Lab , starting in the 1960s in what he called the \" Golden Age \" of research . Most recently , he was a research professor of geology at Union College and continued to value this association through the rest of his life . Bob ' s early seminal work at GE was on hardening of solids , and later work was on nuclear tracks in solids . This latter field brought with it extensive collaborations in multiple disciplines , including health physics . He and his colleagues designed the cosmic - ray detector taken to the moon and back by the Apollo 16 astronauts , studied the damaging effects of cosmic rays on moon rocks , and dated meteorites and archeological specimens . He published over 350 scientific papers and held 19 patents . His track work led to a company being founded by GE ( Terradex : measuring radon in homes and locating shallow deposits of uranium in the ground ) . Some of Bob ' s many awards include the American Nuclear Society ' s Special Award for Distinguished Service in the Advancement of Nuclear Science in 1964 , the U . S . Atomic Energy Commission ' s E . O . Lawrence Award in 1971 , and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration ' s Medal for Exceptional Scientific Achievement in 1973 . He was elected to the National Academy of Engineering and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences . He coauthored Nuclear Tracks in Solids , wrote Tracks to Innovation , and coedited book sets on intermetallic compounds . He collaborated and jointly published papers with Dr . Otto Raabe early in both of their careers . Dr . Fleischer was a longtime member of the Health Physics Society and the Northeastern New York Chapter .

{"text": "Our group is using molecular , genetic and electrophysiological techniques to explore the molecular and neuronal basis of innate social behaviors in the mouse . Two major lines of research are currently being pursued in the laboratory : We are pursuing several projects at the molecular , cellular and systems levels in order to investigate the architecture and functional logic of neuronal circuits underlying social behaviors . The key questions we are addressing are : What are the sensory signals that trigger specific social behaviors ? What are the brain areas involved in processing these signals and generating species - and sex - specific behaviors such as aggression , mating , parental behavior , defensive behavior ? What is the molecular identity of the neurons involved , how are they connected to each other , and how are they modulated by the animal physiological state and its previous social experience ? And finally , how do circuits underlying sex - specific behaviors differ in the male and female brains ? The second set of projects explores the phenomenon of genomic imprinting in the brain , and the role of this mode of epigenetic modification in brain development and adult brain function . Genomic imprinting results in preferential expression of the paternally , or the maternally inherited allele of certain genes . We have recently used a genome - wide approach to characterize the repertoire of imprinted genes in the mouse embryonic and adult CNS . Our study uncovered a large number of new loci with imprinted features , suggesting that imprinting is a major mode of epigenetic regulation in the brain . Imprinting appears to preferentially affect neural systems associated with social , motivational and homeostatic brain functions . Comparison of the imprinted gene repertoire in the adult hypothalamus and cortex , and in the developing brain demonstrates a complex spatiotemporal , species - , sex - and isoform - specific regulation . Genomic imprinting thus emerges as a major and dynamic mode of epigenetic regulation of brain function , with direct implications for the understanding of evolution and diseases . Future projects in the lab will aim at better understanding this mode of epigenetic regulation in mechanistic and functional terms", "tokens": ["Our", "group", "is", "using", "molecular", ",",

{"text": "He was elected a Fellow of the IEEE in January 1992 for his contributions to Digital Wireless Communications and Optical Fiber Systems and Networks . The \" Fellow of the IEEE \" , is the highest scientific rank in the electrical engineering society and is reserved for those who have made exceptional contributions to the field . In Dr . Kavehrad ' s case , the award was mainly for his pioneering role in creation of \" WiFi \" ; as in several Bell Laboratories published papers in early 1980s and by a real feasibility model development , at Crawford Hill Bell Laboratories Research , Dr . Kavehrad proposed one of the first wideband direct - sequence spread spectrum ( W - CDMA ) wireless systems with CDMA base - stations for voice / data / video transmissions inside buildings ( Origins of Hot - Spots and WiFi ) - watch a short video clip ; \" WiFi - First - Trial - Bell Labs \" that has a historical value . This was done well before the activities of Qualcomm Inc and other companies on CDMA access in mobile cellular and wireless LANs applications . These works , as stated by the FCC rule makers , speeded up the FCC allocation of the ISM bands . The 802 . 11b standard has its roots back in these works , as well . At the time , these were daunting tasks to take on at Bell Labs . Later , many industries followed these patented published pioneering works to the product level . Among these were Apple Inc and Lucent Technologies , etc . He is now an IEEE Life Fellow . In June 1987 , he started a special series of articles in the IEEE Communications Magazine and in his Guest Editorial he laid the foundations for both what is known today as \" WiFi \" and \" Visible Light Communications - VLC \" . For technology transfer he formulated a workshop called \" Spread Spectrum Potential Commercial Applications Myth or Reality ? \" in Le Chateau Montebello in Montebello , Quebec , Canada . The event extended over May 21 - 23 , 1991 whose participants were the renowned contributors to this field . Of interest is the Letter , by Dr . Andrew J .

{"text": "I grew up in Seattle , Washington , and lived and worked in California , New York , and Montreal before moving to North Carolina in 1999 . My employment history includes the US Naval Postgraduate School , NOAAs Pacific Marine Environmental Laboratory , and private - sector consulting in addition to work in academia . I currently teach synoptic meteorology at both undergraduate and graduate levels , and numerical modeling of the atmosphere . In my research group , we study the dynamics and prediction of high - impact weather systems , including tropical and extratropical cyclones , convective storms , and topographically forced flows such as cold - air damming . Improved understanding of such weather systems can lead to improved forecasts and also to improved representation of the associated physical processes in numerical models . One area of emphasis is understanding of how diabatic processes , such as the release of heat by condensation , influences storm dynamics . A natural extension of this work is the study of how climate change affects these high - impact weather systems ; warming and associated increases in water vapor alters the dynamics of storms , presenting an interesting and important aspect to an overall understanding of how climate change affects our environment . Some of my recent research projects include investigation of how climate change could impact extreme weather ( hurricanes , floods , and midlatitude cyclones ) , improving numerical model representation of convection and precipitation processes , increasing understanding of the factors that control the intensity and distribution of precipitation accompanying landfalling tropical cyclones , and weather patterns associated with prolific lightning events in central North Carolina . My research group currently consists of five graduate students as of Summer / Fall , 2013 , and our group collaborates with that of Prof . Walt Robinson , among others ( see picture ) . In addition to teaching and research , I have also recently taken on the responsibility of \" Director of Graduate Programs \" in the Department of Marine , Earth , and Atmospheric Science . In this position , I am working with a committee of faculty members to improve procedures and documentation in our graduate program , in addition to answering many , many questions from current and prospective students . In recent years , I ' ve also taken an interest in meteorological consulting ; providing expert meteorological testimony in several weather - related cases has taught me that such applied atmospheric detective work is both interesting and valuable in practical decision - making in our courts of law .

{"text": "I was born in Berlin in 1931 and lived there during the fi rst 2 years of my life . It was only natural , therefore , that the fi rst language I had learned was German . Speaking predominantly in German continued after we had moved back to Hungary . This was due to two prime reasons . We spoke German at home because my father , who had written many of his papers and some of his books in German , wanted to remain highly profi cient in that language . The second reason was that due to the very busy life my parents led , they successively hired several fruleins to take care of me . They were all German . Consequently , my Hungarian language skills were quite limited when I entered grammar school . As a result , the fi rst 2 years in grammar school were rather diffi cult for me . In Hungarian education , a great deal of emphasis is put on memorization . For example , we had to commit many poems to memory . Poetry plays a notable role in Hungarian life , to the extent that sometimes it is said that in Hungary everyone is a poet . And the culture has indeed created numerous wonderful , outstanding poets . So one of the tasks we had in grammar school was to memorize poems , which we then had to recite in class . Because of my limited language skills I had great diffi culties with this , in particular with poems containing infrequent words . It was almost like trying to memorize nonsense syllables . As a result , for a while I was considered to be mentally retarded . Countering this defi ciency of mine I immersed myself in memorization . In the ensuing years I memorized hundreds of Hungarian folk songs as well as numerous piano compositions by Bach , Bartk , and Kodly . I especially loved Bartks works based on Hungarian folk songs , and I still have a copy of one of his music books entitled For Children . I am proud of the fact that I had actually met Bla Bartk in my early teens . His house was just down the street from where we lived .", "tokens": ["I", "was", "born", "in", "Berlin", "in", "1931", "and", "lived", "there", "during", "the", "fi", "rst", "2", "years", "of", "my", "life", ".", "It", "was", "only", "natural", ",", "therefore", ",", "that", "the", "fi", "rst", "language", "I", "had", "learned", "was", "German", ".", "Speaking", "predominantly", "in", "German", "continued", "after", "we", "had", "moved", "back", "to", "Hungary", ".", "This", "was", "due", "to", "two", "prime", "reasons", ".", "We", "spoke", "German", "at", "home", "because", "my", "father", ",", "who", "had", "written", "many", "of", "his", "papers", "and", "some", "of", "his", "books", "in", "German", ",", "wanted", "to", "remain", "highly", "profi", "cient", "in", "that", "language", ".", "The", "second", "reason", "was", "that", "due", "to", "the", "very", "busy", "life", "my", "parents", "led", ",", "they", "successively", "hired", "several", "fruleins", "to", "take", "care", "of", "me", ".", "They", "were", "all", "German", ".", "Consequently", ",", "my", "Hungarian", "language", "skills", "were", "quite", "limited", "when", "I", "entered", "grammar", "school", ".", "As", "a", "result", ",", "the", "fi", "rst", "2", "years", "in", "grammar", "school", "were", "rather", "diffi", "cult", "for", "me", ".", "In", "Hungarian", "education", ",", "a", "great", "deal", "of", "emphasis", "is", "put", "on", "memorization", ".", "For", "example", ",", "we", "had", "to", "commit", "many", "poems", "to", "memory", ".", "Poetry", "plays", "a", "notable", "role", "in", "Hungarian", "life", ",", "to", "the", "extent", "that", "sometimes", "it", "is", "said", "that", "in", "Hungary", "everyone", "is", "a", "poet", ".", "And", "the", "culture", "has", "indeed", "created", "numerous", "wonderful", ",", "outstanding", "poets", ".", "So", "one", "of", "the", "tasks", "we", "had", "in", "grammar", "school", "was", "to", "memorize", "poems", ",", "which", "we", "then", "had", "to", "recite", "in", "class", ".", "Because", "of", "my", "limited", "language", "skills", "I", "had", "great", "diffi", "culties", "with", "this", ",", "in", "particular", "with", "poems", "containing", "infrequent", "words", ".", "It", "was", "almost", "like", "trying", "to", "memorize", "nonsense", "syllables", ".", "As", "a", "result", ",", "for", "a", "while", "I", "was", "considered", "to", "be", "mentally", "retarded", ".", "Countering", "this", "defi", "ciency", "of", "mine", "I", "immersed", "myself", "in", "memorization", ".", "In", "the", "ensuing", "years", "I", "memorized", "hundreds", "of", "Hungarian", "folk", "songs", "as", "well", "as", "numerous", "piano", "compositions", "by", "Bach", ",", "Bartk", ",", "and", "Kodly", ".", "I", "especially", "loved", "Bartks", "works", "based", "on", "Hungarian", "folk", "songs", ",", "and", "I", "still", "have", "a", "copy", "of", "one", "of", "his", "music", "books", "entitled", "For", "Children", ".", "I", "am", "proud", "of", "the", "fact", "that", "I", "had", "actually", "met", "Bla", "Bartk", "in", "my", "early", "teens", ".", "His", "house", "was", "just", "down", "the", "street", "from", "where", "we", "lived", "."], "record": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_0> birth place <extra_id_5> Berlin <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> birthday <extra_id_5> 1931 <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1>", "entity": [{"type": "birth place", "offset": [4], "text": "Berlin"}, {"type": "birthday", "offset": [6], "text": "1931"}], "relation": [], "event": [], "spot": ["birthday", "birth place"], "asoc": [], "spot_asoc": [{"span": "Berlin", "label": "birth place", "asoc": []}, {"span": "1931", "label": "birthday", "asoc": []}]}

{"text": "Kelle H . Moley , M . D . , co - directs the Institute of Clinical and Translational Sciences at Washington University in St . Louis , MO . She is a professor of obstetrics and gynecology and was named vice chair for basic science research and director of the Division of Basic Science Research in the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology at Washington University School of Medicine in St . Louis in March 2006 and the inaugural James P . Crane Professor of Obstetrics and Gynecology in June 2009 . As part of her appointment , Moley is responsible for developing a strategic plan and direction for the new division and enhancing the current program in Reproductive Science . Also a professor in cell biology and physiology , Moley is one of a handful of people in the world studying the effects of maternal type 1 and type 2 diabetes and obesity on gametes , implantation and development of mice embryos . Her work has established that short term exposure to high concentrations of glucose or insulin during the first 72 hours following fertilization is enough to alter the embryos and result in the increase in congenital malformations and miscarriages , as seen in women with diabetes and other metabolic disorders . She also is known for cloning and characterizing two novel glucose transporters , GLUT8 and GLUT9 . Her work on these proteins demonstrates altered location and expression of these transporters in response to insulin exposure and diabetes , respectively . Her research has impacted our understanding of reproductive performance and glucose utilization in diabetic animal models how this may be applicable to the pathophysiology of diabetes in humans . She is principal investigator on several NIH grants exploring reproductive biology .

{"text": "Gallos laboratory investigates the cell biology of neuronal development , specifically the mechanisms of axon development . An emphasis of the laboratory is on understanding how extracellular signals regulate the axonal cytoskeleton ( actin filaments and microtubules ) , and thus axon development . We are currently analyzing the mechanism of axon branch formation in response to neurotrophins , which are major determinants of axon development and serve to sculpt the final morphology of axons . The laboratory employs in vitro and in vivo approaches to manipulate and measure signaling pathways and the neuronal cytoskeleton . Through high resolution imaging we have been able to uncover novel aspects of the cytoskeletal and signaling mechanism of axon branching . We have found that localized microdomains of phosphoinositide 3 - kinase ( PI3K ) signaling drive the formation of axonal actin filament patches , which in turn serve as the first step in the initiation of axon branches . Furthermore , we found that the induction of branches by nerve growth factor ( NGF ) requires the mitochondria - dependent axonal translation of mRNAs for cytoskeletal proteins involved in branching . Our current work aims to unveil how NGF signaling regulates the dynamics and function of axonal mitochondria and continue detailing the role of mitochondria in axon branching . An additional line of research focuses on understanding how axons respond to physical injury , as occurs in spinal cord injury and traumatic brain injury , and how the physical injury is translated into disruption of the axonal cytoskeleton ultimately leading to axon severing and degeneration . We are also analyzing the mechanisms used by extracellular signals to impair the regeneration of axons , focusing on a class of molecules termed chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans ( CSPGs ) . By understanding the mechanisms of injury induced axon severing and CSPG - mediated inhibition of axon regeneration we aim to develop approaches for minimizing these events in the context of the injured adult nervous system .

{"text": "Research Focus I study chromosome movements during cell division . We try to understand the entire process of cell division , but concentrate on chromosome movements during anaphase . During anaphase , chromosomes move slowly to a spindle pole , near the speed of a tectonic plate . One simple question is : what produces the force that causes the chromosome to move poleward ? All agree that the spindle fibre associated with the chromosome contains microtubules , and that the fibre propels the chromosomes poleward , but there is no agreement on how this is done . Most work concentrates on microtubules , but there are other components in spindle fibres including actin and myosin ; no - one knows what the different components do . One way we studied this was to irradiate small portions of spindles using a focussed beam of ultraviolet light ( a UV microbeam ) or a laser microbeam ; after irradiation we studied chromosome or spindle pole movement in the irradiated cells using video microscopy and we looked at the structure of the irradiated spot using immunofluorescence ( confocal ) and electron microscopy . Chromosomes moved normally after the UV severed both microtubules and actin ( Forer et al . , 2003 ; Sheykhani et al . , 2013a ) , so we argue that chromosomes move because a spindle matrix propels the chromosomes spindle fibre poleward ( review in Johansen et al . , 2011 ; Forer et al . , 2015 ) . We implicated actin and myosin in force production using inhibitors ( e . g . , Sheykhani et al . , 2013b ) , and we identified titin , another muscle protein , in spindles ( Fabian et al . , 2007 ) ; thus the matrix might contain actin , myosin and titin . We also study signalling between chromosomes . Irradiation of a spindle fibre in anaphase temporarily blocks the motion of the associated chromosome , but it also blocks the motion of the partner chromosome ( moving to the opposite pole ) . The partner stops moving because of a signal sent across the interzone : when the interzone is irradiated first , only the chromosome associated with the fibre stops moving , not the partner ( Yin and Forer , 1996 ) . There are other signals as well : in distance segregation , unpaired chromosomes nonetheless move to opposite poles , but we have no idea how they signal to each other ( Ferraro - Gideon et al . , 2013 , 2014 ; Forer et al . , 2013 ) .", "tokens": ["Research", "Focus", "I", "study", "chromosome", "movements", "during", "cell", "division", ".", "We", "try", "to", "understand", "the", "entire", "process", "of", "cell", "division", ",", "but", "concentrate", "on", "chromosome", "movements", "during", "anaphase", ".", "During", "anaphase", ",", "chromosomes", "move", "slowly", "to", "a", "spindle", "pole", ",", "near", "the", "speed", "of", "a", "tectonic", "plate", ".", "One", "simple", "question", "is", ":", "what", "produces", "the", "force", "that", "causes", "the", "chromosome", "to", "move", "poleward", "?", "All", "agree", "that", "the", "spindle", "fibre", "associated", "with", "the", "chromosome", "contains", "microtubules", ",", "and", "that", "the", "fibre", "propels", "the", "chromosomes", "poleward", ",", "but", "there", "is", "no", "agreement", "on", "how", "this", "is", "done", ".", "Most", "work", "concentrates", "on", "microtubules", ",", "but", "there", "are", "other", "components", "in", "spindle", "fibres", "including", "actin", "and", "myosin", ";", "no", "-", "one", "knows", "what", "the", "different", "components", "do", ".", "One", "way", "we", "studied", "this", "was", "to", "irradiate", "small", "portions", "of", "spindles", "using", "a", "focussed", "beam", "of", "ultraviolet", "light", "(", "a", "UV", "microbeam", ")", "or", "a", "laser", "microbeam", ";", "after", "irradiation", "we", "studied", "chromosome", "or", "spindle", "pole", "movement", "in", "the", "irradiated", "cells", "using", "video", "microscopy", "and", "we", "looked", "at", "the", "structure", "of", "the", "irradiated", "spot", "using", "immunofluorescence", "(", "confocal", ")", "and", "electron", "microscopy", ".", "Chromosomes", "moved", "normally", "after", "the", "UV", "severed", "both", "microtubules", "and", "actin", "(", "Forer", "et", "al", ".", ",", "2003", ";", "Sheykhani", "et", "al", ".", ",", "2013a", ")", ",", "so", "we", "argue", "that", "chromosomes", "move", "because", "a", "spindle", "matrix", "propels", "the", "chromosomes", "spindle", "fibre", "poleward", "(", "review", "in", "Johansen", "et", "al", ".", ",", "2011", ";", "Forer", "et", "al", ".", ",", "2015", ")", ".", "We", "implicated", "actin", "and", "myosin", "in", "force", "production", "using", "inhibitors", "(", "e", ".", "g", ".", ",", "Sheykhani", "et", "al", ".", ",", "2013b", ")", ",", "and", "we", "identified", "titin", ",", "another", "muscle", "protein", ",", "in", "spindles", "(", "Fabian", "et", "al", ".", ",", "2007", ")", ";", "thus", "the", "matrix", "might", "contain", "actin", ",", "myosin", "and", "titin", ".", "We", "also", "study", "signalling", "between", "chromosomes", ".", "Irradiation", "of", "a", "spindle", "fibre", "in", "anaphase", "temporarily", "blocks", "the", "motion", "of", "the", "associated", "chromosome", ",", "but", "it", "also", "blocks", "the", "motion", "of", "the", "partner", "chromosome", "(", "moving", "to", "the", "opposite", "pole", ")", ".", "The", "partner", "stops", "moving", "because", "of", "a", "signal", "sent", "across", "the", "interzone", ":", "when", "the", "interzone", "is", "irradiated", "first", ",", "only", "the", "chromosome", "associated", "with", "the", "fibre", "stops", "moving", ",", "not", "the", "partner", "(", "Yin", "and", "Forer", ",", "1996", ")", ".", "There", "are", "other", "signals", "as", "well", ":", "in", "distance", "segregation", ",", "unpaired", "chromosomes", "nonetheless", "move", "to", "opposite", "poles", ",", "but", "we", "have", "no", "idea", "how", "they", "signal", "to", "each", "other", "(", "Ferraro", "-", "Gideon", "et", "al", ".", ",", "2013", ",", "2014", ";", "Forer", "et", "al", ".", ",", "2013", ")", "."], "record": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_0> research interests <extra_id_5> chromosome movements during cell division <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1>", "entity": [{"type": "research interests", "offset": [4, 5, 6, 7, 8], "text": "chromosome movements during cell division"}], "relation": [], "event": [], "spot": ["research interests"], "asoc": [], "spot_asoc": [{"span": "chromosome movements during cell division", "label": "research interests", "asoc": []}]}
{"text": "Our group explores the mechanisms underlying the organization of cells into highly ordered structures in the developing brain . During brain development , neural stem cells generate a large number of neurons and glia of different fates at appropriate points in time ; the framework and size of the brain depend on the spatiotemporal behavior of neural stem cells , which are highly dynamic in their modes of division and gene expression . Using invertebrate ( Drosophila ) and vertebrate ( mouse and ferret ) model systems , we focus our study on the programs by which behaviors of neural stem cells are controlled and brain development is governed . Drosophila neural stem cells , called neuroblasts , provide an excellent model system for the investigation of fundamental aspects of asymmetric division , a process essential to the generation of cells of divergent type during proliferation . We have been investigating mechanisms controlling asymmetric divisions , including the cell polarity and spindle orientation . We also extend our research scope to understand how neurogenesis is controlled in tissue space depending on the environments that surround the nervous system . We recently identified an extrinsic mechanism that controls the orientation of division ( cell polarity ) in neuroblasts relative to the overriding ectoderm ( Yoshiura et al . , 2012 ) , which determines the orientation of neural tissue growth . The vertebrate brain evolved rapidly , resulting in an expansion of the size of the brain , which comprises a larger number of neurons arranged in a vastly more complex functional network than that in invertebrate . Neural stem cells typically adopt three statesproliferative ( symmetrically dividing ) , neurogenic ( asymmetrically dividing ) , and restingand undergo transitions among the states , on which the basic organization of the brain depend . We are investigating mechanisms that determine the individual states of neural stem cells , and control transitions between states in mouse as well as mechanisms for generating neural progenitor cell diversity ( see figure ) . We recently discovered a novel transition in the division mode in the developing mouse cortex from radial glia ( typical neural stem cells with the epithelial structure ) to translocating neural stem cells , basal radial glia ( Shitamukai et al . , 2011 ) , which become a major population of neural stem cells in mammals with gyrencephalic brains , such as primates and ferrets . We are investigating the mechanisms that underlie the formation , maintenance , and expansion of these neural stem cells , by using model mice that produce large numbers of basal radial glia as well as ferrets as a model forming the complex brain ( Tsunekawa et al . , 2016 ) .", "tokens": ["Our", "group", "explores", "the", "mechanisms", "underlying", "the", "organization", "of", "cells", "into",

{"text": "Just before leaving Middlesex , Dick received a telephone call from the Radiation Laboratory at Berkeley offering him the part - time job as a computer programmer for which he had applied . Through this job , he became aware of linear and quadratic programming and the contributions of George Dantzig and Philip Wolfe . Before long , Dick left the Rad Lab to join Dantzig ' s team at the Operations Research Center at UC Berkeley . Under the tutelage of George Dantzig ( and the late Edmund Eisenberg ) , Dick developed a symmetric duality theory and what was then called the \" composite problem \" . These topics along with a rexamination of the Fritz John conditions , formed the core of his doctoral dissertation . The composite problem involved a fusion of the primal and dual first - order optimality conditions . It was realized that the resulting inequality system could be studied without reference to the primal - dual structure out of which it was born . The name \" complementarity problem \" was suggested by Dick and introduced in a joint paper with Habetler and Lemke . After Berkeley , Dick ' s work took two closely related directions . One was the study of quadratic programming ; the other was what we now call \" linear complementarity \" . The interesting role played by classes of matrices in both these areas has always held a special fascination for Dick . In quadratic programming , for instance , with Jacques Ferland he obtained characterizations of quasi - and pseudo - convexity of quadratic functions . Dick ( and others ) were quick to recognize the importance of matrix classes in linear complementarity theory . It was he who proposed the name \" copositive - plus \" for a matrix class that arose in Lemke ' s seminal paper of 1965 . The name first appeared in the classic paper of Cottle and Dantzig called \" Complementary Pivot Theory of Mathematical Programming \" . The subjects of quadratic programming and linear complementarity ( and the associated matrix theory ) remain central to his research interests .", "tokens": ["Just", "before", "leaving", "Middlesex", ",", "Dick", "received", "a", "telephone", "call", "from", "the", "Radiation", "Laboratory", "at", "Berkeley", "offering", "him", "the", "part", "-", "time", "job", "as", "a", "computer", "programmer", "for", "which", "he", "had", "applied", ".", "Through", "this", "job", ",", "he", "became", "aware", "of", "linear", "and", "quadratic", "programming", "and", "the", "contributions", "of", "George", "Dantzig", "and", "Philip", "Wolfe", ".", "Before", "long", ",", "Dick", "left", "the", "Rad", "Lab", "to", "join", "Dantzig", "'", "s", "team", "at", "the", "Operations", "Research", "Center", "at", "UC", "Berkeley", ".", "Under", "the", "tutelage", "of", "George", "Dantzig", "(", "and", "the", "late", "Edmund", "Eisenberg", ")", ",", "Dick", "developed", "a", "symmetric", "duality", "theory", "and", "what", "was", "then", "called", "the", "\"", "composite", "problem", "\"", ".", "These", "topics", "along", "with", "a", "rexamination", "of", "the", "Fritz", "John", "conditions", ",", "formed", "the", "core", "of", "his", "doctoral", "dissertation", ".", "The", "composite", "problem", "involved", "a", "fusion", "of", "the", "primal", "and", "dual", "first", "-", "order", "optimality", "conditions", ".", "It", "was", "realized", "that", "the", "resulting", "inequality", "system", "could", "be", "studied", "without", "reference", "to", "the", "primal", "-", "dual", "structure", "out", "of", "which", "it", "was", "born", ".", "The", "name", "\"", "complementarity", "problem", "\"", "was", "suggested", "by", "Dick", "and", "introduced", "in", "a", "joint", "paper", "with", "Habetler", "and", "Lemke", ".", "After", "Berkeley", ",", "Dick", "'", "s", "work", "took", "two", "closely", "related", "directions", ".", "One", "was", "the", "study", "of", "quadratic", "programming", ";", "the", "other", "was", "what", "we", "now", "call", "\"", "linear", "complementarity", "\"", ".", "The", "interesting", "role", "played", "by", "classes", "of", "matrices", "in", "both", "these", "areas", "has", "always", "held", "a", "special", "fascination", "for", "Dick", ".", "In", "quadratic", "programming", ",", "for", "instance", ",", "with", "Jacques", "Ferland", "he", "obtained", "characterizations", "of", "quasi", "-", "and", "pseudo", "-", "convexity", "of", "quadratic", "functions", ".", "Dick", "(", "and", "others", ")", "were", "quick", "to", "recognize", "the", "importance", "of", "matrix", "classes", "in", "linear", "complementarity", "theory", ".", "It", "was", "he", "who", "proposed", "the", "name", "\"", "copositive", "-", "plus", "\"", "for", "a", "matrix", "class", "that", "arose", "in", "Lemke", "'", "s", "seminal", "paper", "of", "1965", ".", "The", "name", "first", "appeared", "in", "the", "classic", "paper", "of", "Cottle", "and", "Dantzig", "called", "\"", "Complementary", "Pivot", "Theory", "of", "Mathematical", "Programming", "\"", ".", "The", "subjects", "of", "quadratic", "programming", "and", "linear", "complementarity", "(", "and", "the", "associated", "matrix", "theory", ")", "remain", "central", "to", "his", "research", "interests", "."], "record": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_0> gender <extra_id_5> him <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> research interests <extra_id_5> quadratic programming <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> work for <extra_id_5> Dantzig ' s team at the Operations Research Center at UC Berkeley <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> research interests <extra_id_5> symmetric duality theory <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> research interests <extra_id_5> linear complementarity <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1>", "entity": [{"type": "work for", "offset": [65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76], "text": "Dantzig ' s team at the Operations Research Center at UC Berkeley"}, {"type": "gender", "offset": [17], "text": "him"}, {"type": "research interests", "offset": [95, 96, 97], "text": "symmetric duality theory"}, {"type": "research interests", "offset": [43, 44], "text": "quadratic programming"}, {"type": "research interests", "offset": [222, 223], "text": "linear complementarity"}], "relation": [], "event": [], "spot": ["gender", "research interests", "work for"], "asoc": [], "spot_asoc": [{"span": "him", "label": "gender", "asoc": []}, {"span": "quadratic programming", "label": "research interests", "asoc": []}, {"span": "Dantzig ' s team at the Operations Research Center at UC Berkeley", "label": "work for", "asoc": []}, {"span": "symmetric duality theory", "label": "research interests", "asoc": []}, {"span": "linear complementarity", "label": "research interests", "asoc": []}]}

{"text": "Research Vocal learning in songbirds is an experimentally accessible model system in which to study the neural mechanisms of learning . Juvenile birds memorize song ( s ) from an adult tutor and then use auditory feedback from their own songs to compare with their memory of the tutor song ( s ) . This comparison guides a process of motor learning ; through practice , juvenile birds gradually learn to produce a highly stereotyped song that resembles the tutor song . Extensive research has investigated the underlying neural circuits that are involved in song learning and production . Our lab uses a variety of electrophysiological , anatomical and behavioral approaches to probe the neural mechanisms that mediate song learning and song behavior . Two main neural circuits have been implicated in song production and learning . The motor pathway descends from forebrain nucleus HVC , which projects to nucleus RA , which then projects to brainstem motor and premotor neurons controlling muscles of the vocal organ , the syrinx , and those of respiration . This pathway is essential for production of song . A second circuit , the anterior forebrain pathway ( AFP ) , arises from HVC as well and projects to the basal ganglia structure area X , which projects to the thalamic nucleus DLM , which projects to a forebrain nucleus LMAN , which projects back to motor pathway nucleus RA . The AFP is essential for vocal learning but not production of previously learned song . Neurons of the AFP exhibit specific responsiveness to auditory information and are therefore well placed to provide the motor pathway with auditory feedback about the quality of the bird ' s own song . Our main long - term goal is to understand at the level of neurons , synapses and circuits how song is learned and produced . Our current work falls into several categories : - Mechanisms of pattern generation in the motor pathway - Structure and function of the anterior forebrain pathway - Evolutionary origin of the anterior forebrain pathway in songbirds - Mechanisms underlying seasonal control of song ( in collaboration with Eliot Brenowitz )", "tokens": ["Research", "Vocal", "learning", "in", "songbirds",

{"text": "Professor Zvonimir Janko was born in Bjelovar , Croatia , in 1932 . He studied mathematics at the University of Zagreb . After graduation he was sent to work at a high school in a small town of Litica ( also known as iroki Brijeg - Wide Hill ) in Bosnia and Herzegovina , where he was teaching physics . There he had already started to publish his first scientific works . It is at that time that he learned about groups , and found it interesting that only four axioms in the definition are the starting point of enormous theory . It is amusing that he was receiving letters from editorial boards indicating \" University of Listica \" in his address ! And the highest educational institution in the town was the high school where he worked . Professor Janko ' s wife Zora is from Litica . He earned his PhD at the University of Zagreb in 1960 under ( formal ) supervision of professor Vladimir Devid . The title of the thesis was Dekompozicija nekih klasa nedegeneriranih Rdeiovih grupa na Schreierova proirenja ( Decomposition of some classes of nondegenerate Rdei Groups on Schreier extensions ) , in which he solved a problem proposed by an oustanding Hungarian mathematician Laszlo Rdei . Professor Stanko Bilinski ( PDF ) was the head of the PhD exam committee . Until 1962 Janko alreday had about ten published journal articles , thus satisfying conditions for the position of assistant professor of mathematics at the University of Zagreb . Despite excellent results of a young talented mathematician , Janko was not able to find an adequate job in the communist Yugoslavia . His only \" fault \" was his particiaption in students ' visit to the grave of the 19th century Croatian politician Dr . Ante Starevi , for which he was draconcially punished by two years of suspension of his studies . This is why his studies were prolonged for two years , from 1950 til 1960 . He applied thirteen times for the position of Research Fellow or Assistent Professor in ex - Yugoslavia , but in vain ( even in Tuzla in Bosnia and Herzgovina . ) Therefore Janko decided to go to Australia , where he spent seven years , 1962 - 1968 . He was first employed at the Australian National University in Canberra where he stayed until 1964 , and then after his discovery of J1 obtained a position of full professor at Monash University in Melbourne , skipping the usual three academic steps . He then moved to the USA , where he spent the period of 1968 - 1972 first as a visiting professor in Princeton , and then as a full professor at the Ohio State University in Columbus . Since 1972 until his retirement in 2000 Janko was a full professor at the University of Heidelberg , Germany . But even after his retirement his scientific activity is still amazing . His work can be roughly divided into three parts : theory of finite groups ( until 1976 ) , finite geometries and design theory ( until 2000 ) , and the theory of p - groups . Professor Janko is a great fan of theatre and a passionate chess player . In 2007 , when he celebrated 75th birthday , his father celebrated 100th brithday in Bjelovar singinig and playing violin .", "tokens": ["Professor", "Zvonimir", "Janko", "was", "born", "in",

{"text": "Research Interests Regulation of Plant Morphogenesis During Growth & Development Plant forms have long delighted artists and naturalists with their variety and beauty . These forms arise through morphogenesis in a process that depends on growth . Cells specify their growth rates in each spatial dimension and these rates are usually different from one another , that is , the growth of plant cells is anisotropic . To build an organ with a defined shape , the plant must control precisely the direction of maximal expansion and the magnitude of expansion anisotropy . Understanding the mechanisms whereby plant cells govern growth anisotropy is the crux of my research . To unearth these mechanisms I am digging in three types of terrain . The first is to understand how cell division and expansion are regulated coordinately . Cell division supplies the plant with building blocks whereas cell expansion determines the shape of the blocks and hence of the whole structure . These processes must be coordinated precisely for morphogenesis to succeed , but those interested in division have typically ignored expansion , and vice versa . My laboratory is quantifying the spatial profiles of cell expansion and division at high spatio - temporal resolution and studying how these change in different environments or in different genetic backgrounds . As part of this effort , I collaborated with a computer scientist to develop a novel image processing routine allowing growth profiles to be measured algorithmically . The second terrain is the role of the cytoskeleton in regulating anisotropic expansion . For years , the cytoskeleton has been known to be important for morphogenesis by virtue of the aberrant morphology that results when the cytoskeleton is disrupted by chemical inhibitors . But how does the cytoskeleton act ? This question requires more than inhibitors to answer . My laboratory has isolated mutants of arabidopsis in which root morphology is aberrant and we are using those to identify proteins that make up the pathway for the control of organ shape . Additionally , we have designed a novel in vitro assay specifically for cortical microtubules , where there behavior can be studied readily and the function of putative players tested directly . The third terrain is the cell wall , the ultimate regulator of cell and organ shape . Cells can expand anisotropically only when the cell wall is mechanically anisotropic . The mechanical anisotropy is provided by cellulose microfibrils , long polymers of glucose crystallized into microfibrils with the tensile strength of steel ; however , it is not known how cellulose alignment is controlled . In addition to the mutational approach mentioned above , my laboratory uses several approaches to study the ultrastructure of the cell wall , including quantitative polarized - light microscopy , field - emission scanning electron microscopy , and atomic force microscopy . The overall goal here is to uncover how anisotropic wall yielding is conditioned by the structural elements of the cell wall .", "tokens": ["Research", "Interests", "Regulation", "of", "Plant",

{"text": "Maria - Gabriella Di Benedetto obtained her Ph . D . in Telecommunications in 1987 from the University of Rome La Sapienza , Italy , with a dissertation on the acoustic and perceptual properties of American - English vowels . In 1991 , she joined the Faculty of Engineering of University of Rome La Sapienza , where currently she is a Full Professor at the Department of Information Engineering , Electronics and Telecommunications . She has held visiting positions at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology , the University of California , Berkeley , and the University of Paris XI , France . In 1994 , she received the Mac Kay Professorship award from the University of California , Berkeley . Dr . Di Benedettos research interests include speech and wireless communications . Her research interest in speech started since 1981 when she developed , during a masters internship at IBM scientific center in Paris , France , a method for detecting voiced vs . voiceless sounds within a project dedicated to the development of computer - based tools for deaf children , and continued later with a Ph . D . topic focused on the acoustic and perceptual properties of vowels , that she mostly developed at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology ( MIT ) in the Speech Communication Group , under the supervision of Prof . Kenneth N . Stevens . In the following years , upon return in Italy , she directed for Sapienza , two European projects on the development of an Interactive system for Spoken European Language Training , and , from 1990 to 2000 , her research focused on the analysis of the Italian language and in particular Italian consonants and gemination , within a project that was funded by Sapienza for a duration of over 10 years . Results of investigations on the Italian language were applied to the development of a speech synthesizer for Italian within the INFOVOX multi - lingual synthesis project . Thanks to the collaboration with the French laboratory LIMSI - CNRS her research on vowels expanded further to tackle the problem of the effect of vocal effort on spectral properties of vowels in French . In the 1990s she was called for her expertise in speech to participate in the working group dedicated to the development of the speech coder for the first cellular communication system ( 2G ) , later known as GSM , under definition in Europe . This experience triggered her interest in wireless communications and as a consequence her research focused on the conception and designing of the next cellular generation . From 1995 to 2000 , she directed for Sapienza four European projects on the design of UMTS ( 3G ) . Since 2000 , she has been active in fostering the development of Ultra Wide Band ( UWB ) radio communications in Europe and directed for Sapienza several pioneering EU projects on UWB communications . As a result of her UWB research , Dr . Di Benedetto published in 2004 with Prentice Hall , the first published book on UWB communications , which included her key contributions to the design of UWB systems , and that was also later translated in Chinese .", "tokens": ["Maria", "-", "Gabriella", "Di", "Benedetto", "obtained", "her", "Ph", ".", "D", ".", "in", "Telecommunications", "in", "1987", "from", "the", "University", "of",

{"text": "My current interests include String Field Theory ( SFT ) , and Two - Time Physics ( 2T - Physics ) and Cosmology . My long term goal is the construction of the unified theory at the fundamental level . My research is driven by some of the current questions in Cosmology , the Standard Model of elementary particles , and unification of forces including quantum gravity in the framework of string theory or M - theory . The mysteries that are hoped to be resolved include the physics of the very early universe and how it determined the gauge symmetries ( forces ) and the families of quarks and leptons ( matter ) that we observe today . Once the fundamental theory is constructed it is likely that it will suggest the best approach to answer our current mysteries , including dark matter , dark energy and a host of issues related to masses and interactions of quarks , leptons and force particles . All the physics we know with certainty today at microscopic or macroscopic distance scales is embodied in principle in the fundamental laws described by the Standard Model of Particles and Forces , and in General Relativity . In 2006 I discovered the 2T Standard Model and in 2008 2T - Gravity , both in 4 - space and 2 - time dimensions . Supersymmetric 2T - field theory in 4+2 dimensions has also been achieved during 2007 - 2009 . From the point of view of these 2T field theories , as well as 2T particle dynamics that I developed since 1995 , all known physical phenomena experienced in 3 - space and 1 - time dimensions , as described in 1T - physics , appear as various shadows of phenomena in 4+2 dimensions . 2T - physics captures hidden properties of physical systems in 3+1 dimensions that are systematically missed by the usual 1T - physics formulation ( see simplest example ) . The existence of such verifiable predictions , that 1T - physics can only confirm but cannot foresee systematically , show that 2T - Physics is a larger unifying framework and an unavoidable completion of 1T - physics . I therefore expect that the methods of 2T - physics will prove to be essential in the construction of the ultimate unified theory as well as in a more complete description of all physics at all scales of distance or of energy . I emphasize symmetries and supersymmetries in much of my research on particle physics , field theory and string theory . From time to time the symmetry structures in physics have led me to discover new physical concepts , such as Two - Time Physics ( 2T - Physics ) , as well as a few new structures in Mathematics or Mathematical Physics , in particular in supergroups , non - compact groups , and noncommutative geometry . This activity also took me on side trips into applications of symmetries in other fields of physics . Consequently , supersymmetry in nuclear physics was experimentally confirmed as an approximate symmetry of bosonic and fermionic nuclei .", "tokens": ["My", "current", "interests", "include", "String", "Field", "Theory", "(", "SFT", ")", ",", "and", "Two", "-", "Time", "Physics", "(", "2T", "-", "Physics", ")", "and", "Cosmology", ".", "My", "long", "term", "goal", "is", "the", "construction", "of", "the", "unified", "theory", "at", "the", "fundamental", "level", ".", "My", "research", "is", "driven", "by", "some", "of", "the", "current", "questions", "in", "Cosmology", ",", "the", "Standard", "Model", "of", "elementary", "particles", ",", "and", "unification", "of", "forces", "including", "quantum", "gravity", "in", "the", "framework", "of", "string", "theory", "or", "M", "-", "theory", ".", "The", "mysteries", "that", "are", "hoped", "to", "be", "resolved", "include", "the", "physics", "of", "the", "very", "early", "universe", "and", "how", "it", "determined", "the", "gauge", "symmetries", "(", "forces", ")", "and", "the", "families", "of", "quarks", "and", "leptons", "(", "matter", ")", "that", "we", "observe", "today", ".", "Once", "the", "fundamental", "theory", "is", "constructed", "it", "is", "likely", "that", "it", "will", "suggest", "the", "best", "approach", "to", "answer", "our", "current", "mysteries", ",", "including", "dark", "matter", ",", "dark", "energy", "and", "a", "host", "of", "issues", "related", "to", "masses", "and", "interactions", "of", "quarks", ",", "leptons", "and", "force", "particles", ".", "All", "the", "physics", "we", "know", "with", "certainty", "today", "at", "microscopic", "or", "macroscopic", "distance", "scales", "is", "embodied", "in", "principle", "in", "the", "fundamental", "laws", "described", "by", "the", "Standard", "Model", "of", "Particles", "and", "Forces", ",", "and", "in", "General", "Relativity", ".", "In", "2006", "I", "discovered", "the", "2T", "Standard", "Model", "and", "in", "2008", "2T", "-", "Gravity", ",", "both", "in", "4", "-", "space", "and", "2", "-", "time", "dimensions", ".", "Supersymmetric", "2T", "-", "field", "theory", "in", "4+2", "dimensions", "has", "also", "been", "achieved", "during", "2007", "-", "2009", ".", "From", "the", "point", "of", "view", "of", "these", "2T", "field", "theories", ",", "as", "well", "as", "2T", "particle", "dynamics", "that", "I", "developed", "since", "1995", ",", "all", "known", "physical", "phenomena", "experienced", "in", "3", "-", "space", "and", "1", "-", "time", "dimensions", ",", "as", "described", "in", "1T", "-", "physics", ",", "appear", "as", "various", "shadows", "of", "phenomena", "in", "4+2", "dimensions", ".", "2T", "-", "physics", "captures", "hidden", "properties", "of", "physical", "systems", "in", "3+1", "dimensions", "that", "are", "systematically", "missed", "by", "the", "usual", "1T", "-", "physics", "formulation", "(", "see", "simplest", "example", ")", ".", "The", "existence", "of", "such", "verifiable", "predictions", ",", "that", "1T", "-", "physics", "can", "only", "confirm", "but", "cannot", "foresee", "systematically", ",", "show", "that", "2T", "-", "Physics", "is", "a", "larger", "unifying", "framework", "and", "an", "unavoidable", "completion", "of", "1T", "-", "physics", ".", "I", "therefore", "expect", "that", "the", "methods", "of", "2T", "-", "physics", "will", "prove", "to", "be", "essential", "in", "the", "construction", "of", "the", "ultimate", "unified", "theory", "as", "well", "as", "in", "a", "more", "complete", "description", "of", "all", "physics", "at", "all", "scales", "of", "distance", "or", "of", "energy", ".", "I", "emphasize", "symmetries", "and", "supersymmetries", "in", "much", "of", "my", "research", "on", "particle", "physics", ",", "field", "theory", "and", "string", "theory", ".", "From", "time", "to", "time", "the", "symmetry", "structures", "in", "physics", "have", "led", "me", "to", "discover", "new", "physical", "concepts", ",", "such", "as", "Two", "-", "Time", "Physics", "(", "2T", "-", "Physics", ")", ",", "as", "well", "as", "a", "few", "new", "structures", "in", "Mathematics", "or", "Mathematical", "Physics", ",", "in", "particular", "in", "supergroups", ",", "non", "-", "compact", "groups", ",", "and", "noncommutative", "geometry", ".", "This", "activity", "also", "took", "me", "on", "side", "trips", "into", "applications", "of", "symmetries", "in", "other", "fields", "of", "physics", ".", "Consequently", ",", "supersymmetry", "in", "nuclear", "physics", "was", "experimentally", "confirmed", "as", "an", "approximate", "symmetry", "of", "bosonic", "and", "fermionic", "nuclei", "."], "record": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_0> research interests <extra_id_5> String Field Theory <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> research interests <extra_id_5> Two -

{"text": "Ph . D . , University of Alberta , 1973 Curator , Ohio University Paleobotanical Herbarium ( OUPH ) Past President , International Organisation of Palaeobotany Associate Editor , American Journal of Botany Research Program Summary Studies of fossil and living land plants are directed toward a fuller understanding of phylogeny and evolution . These are explored using data from morphological , anatomical , ultrastructural , developmental , and molecular characters . Evaluations of ontogeny , reproductive biology , and organismal interactions are emphasized in interpreting development of the modern flora within the context of evolutionary ecology . Research projects on a wide range of organismal biology topics are available for both undergraduate and graduate students who wish to become practicing scientists . These studies often focus on fossil plants , but structure , growth and development and physiology studies of living plants also are conducted . Anyone interested in doing original research and / or conducting his or her PBIO 404 undergraduate research in organismal botany , may contact Dr .

After briefly serving in the Navy , he was appointed to the faculty in 1968 in Penns School of Medicine . He became a full professor in 1975 . Dr . Zweiman chaired the division of allergy and immunology from 1974 until he became emeritus in 1998 . As a young faculty member , Dr . Zweiman expanded the traditional role of the allergist by taking on the challenge of patients who presented with all manner of immune - mediated diseases . He pioneered the field that would one day be known as clinical immunology . In addition to maintaining a busy practice of patients at Penn , he helped establish the hospitals renal transplant program . He developed the hospitals first clinical immunology service laboratory . In addition , he forged strong links between the teaching , patient care and research missions of the departments of medicine , neurology , pathology and laboratory medicine . Widely regarded for his many accomplishments , Dr . Zweiman was editor of the Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology , chair of the American Board of Allergy and Immunology and president of the American Academy of Allergy , Asthma and Immunology ( AAAAI ) . His service was recognized by his receipt of the Distinguished Service Award and the establishment of the Burton Zweiman Lectureship by the AAAAI . In addition , Dr . Zweiman was a 1967 recipient of the Universitys Lindback Award for Distinguished Teaching . Dr . Zweiman is survived by his wife , Claire ; daughters , Amy Harwood and Diane Weidenbaum ; grandchildren , Daniel , Alexander , Reese and Sage ; and sister , Deborah Gordon .", "tokens": ["Dr", ".",

{"text": "An appreciation for macromolecular structure began when he was an undergraduate at Yale and continued throughout his graduate studies at CalTech and postdoctoral studies at the MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology in Cambridge , England . In the early 1980s , Agard felt that the time was right to combine the then new technology of molecular biology with structural biology to better understand the complex relationship between gene sequence , protein structure , and biological function at a molecular level . A gene codes for the linear sequence of amino acids that make up a protein . Proteins in a cell act as enzymes performing chemical reactions or as structural elements . When forming , a string of amino acids folds into a three - dimensional shape , which determines the molecule ' s function . Change part of the gene ' s code , and the resulting protein ' s form and activity may be impaired or altered in an interesting way . In the early 1980s , when he came to the University of California , San Francisco , Agard particularly began to focus on alpha - lytic protease , an enzyme that breaks down nutrients for a soil bacterium . Agard chose the enzyme to study because its ability to survive outside of the microbe in the harsh and unpredictable environment of the soil might provide insights about other proteins . Ultimately , Agard found something unexpected about the enzyme : when it folded into its functional form it was unstable and not at its \" lowest energy condition . \" Up until that point , scientists thought proteins naturally fold into their lowest energy state . But Agard showed that during the protease ' s formation , it uses a molecular scaffold , called the pro region , to create a higher - energy , protein structure . Although thermodynamically unstable , the mature form of this protein is functionally stabilized by a large kinetic barrier that effectively blocks its unfolding . Simultaneously , this allows the mature form to be quite rigid , providing powerful protection from other bacterial enzymes and changes in soil chemistry . Since then , scientists have found that nature makes other thermodynamically unstable proteins for a variety of purposes . Agard continues to study alpha - lytic protease and has expanded the complexity of his research to multiple - molecule interactions . He is particularly interested in the Hsp90 molecular chaperone protein because it binds to and facilitates the folding and function of hundreds , or possibly thousands , of proteins inside the cell

{"text": "Dr . Elliot McVeigh is the Bessey Darling Massey Professor of Biomedical Engineering at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine and a professor in the Johns Hopkins Carey Business School . His research focuses on cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) . Dr . McVeigh serves as the director of the Department of Biomedical Engineering and the director of the Medical Imaging Laboratory . Dr . McVeigh received his undergraduate degree in physics from the University of Toronto . He earned his Ph . D . from the University of Toronto in 1988 . Immediately following his Ph . D . , Dr . McVeigh joined the faculty of radiology at Johns Hopkins , working with Elias Zerhouni to develop a research program in cardiac MRI . In 1991 , Dr . McVeigh founded the Medical Imaging Laboratory in the Department of Biomedical Engineering as part of a Whitaker Development Award . Many novel MR imaging techniques were developed in the cardiac MRI research group during this period : myocardial tagging for evaluating local muscle contraction ; myocardial perfusion estimates with dynamic imaging of contrast injections ; and late enhancement imaging to clearly image myocardial infarction . These techniques form the foundation of the modern cardiac MRI exam . Dr . McVeigh ' ' s laboratory also demonstrated the ability of MRI to evaluate the benefit of cardiac resynchronization therapy ( CRT ) in the failing heart ; these studies were seminal in understanding how CRT should be used . In 1999 , Dr . McVeigh joined the Laboratory of Cardiac Energetics at the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda to develop a research program in cardiovascular interventional MRI . Working with clinical colleagues , Dr . McVeigh ' ' s laboratory demonstrated numerous novel applications for the first time , three of which were the first MRI - guided injections of therapeutic agents directly into the myocardium ; the first simultaneous electrical and mechanical measurements of cardiac function with MR ; and the first MR guided aortic valve replacement in the beating heart . Among his many achievements , Dr . McVeigh is an inventor on eight patents for real - time interventional MRI and real - time MRI devices , has published more than 150 peer - reviewed research papers and has mentored more than 20 graduate students . His vision for the Department of Biomedical Engineering is to produce new knowledge from stellar laboratories and promote the transfer of that knowledge into patient care at the fastest pace possible .", "tokens": ["Dr", ".", "Elliot", "McVeigh", "is", "the", "Bessey", "Darling", "Massey", "Professor", "of", "Biomedical", "Engineering", "at", "the", "Johns", "Hopkins", "School", "of", "Medicine", "and", "a", "professor", "in", "the", "Johns", "Hopkins", "Carey", "Business", "School", ".", "His", "research", "focuses", "on", "cardiovascular", "magnetic", "resonance", "imaging", "(", "MRI", ")", ".", "Dr", ".", "McVeigh", "serves", "as", "the", "director", "of", "the", "Department", "of", "Biomedical", "Engineering", "and", "the", "director", "of", "the", "Medical", "Imaging", "Laboratory", ".", "Dr", ".", "McVeigh", "received", "his", "undergraduate", "degree", "in", "physics", "from", "the", "University", "of", "Toronto", ".", "He", "earned", "his", "Ph", ".", "D", ".", "from", "the", "University", "of", "Toronto", "in", "1988", ".", "Immediately", "following", "his", "Ph", ".", "D", ".", ",", "Dr", ".", "McVeigh", "joined", "the", "faculty", "of", "radiology", "at", "Johns", "Hopkins", ",", "working", "with", "Elias", "Zerhouni", "to", "develop", "a", "research", "program", "in", "cardiac", "MRI", ".", "In", "1991", ",", "Dr", ".", "McVeigh", "founded", "the", "Medical", "Imaging", "Laboratory", "in", "the", "Department", "of", "Biomedical", "Engineering", "as", "part", "of", "a", "Whitaker", "Development", "Award", ".", "Many", "novel", "MR", "imaging", "techniques", "were", "developed", "in", "the", "cardiac", "MRI", "research", "group", "during", "this", "period", ":", "myocardial", "tagging", "for", "evaluating", "local", "muscle", "contraction", ";", "myocardial", "perfusion", "estimates", "with", "dynamic", "imaging", "of", "contrast", "injections", ";", "and", "late", "enhancement", "imaging", "to", "clearly", "image", "myocardial", "infarction", ".", "These", "techniques", "form", "the", "foundation", "of", "the", "modern", "cardiac", "MRI", "exam", ".", "Dr", ".", "McVeigh", "'", "'", "s", "laboratory", "also", "demonstrated", "the", "ability", "of", "MRI", "to", "evaluate", "the", "benefit", "of", "cardiac", "resynchronization", "therapy", "(", "CRT", ")", "in", "the", "failing", "heart", ";", "these", "studies", "were", "seminal", "in", "understanding", "how", "CRT", "should", "be", "used", ".", "In", "1999", ",", "Dr", ".", "McVeigh", "joined", "the", "Laboratory", "of", "Cardiac", "Energetics", "at", "the", "National", "Institutes", "of", "Health", "in", "Bethesda", "to", "develop", "a", "research", "program", "in", "cardiovascular", "interventional", "MRI", ".", "Working", "with", "clinical", "colleagues", ",", "Dr", ".", "McVeigh", "'", "'", "s", "laboratory", "demonstrated", "numerous", "novel", "applications", "for", "the", "first", "time", ",", "three", "of", "which", "were", "the", "first", "MRI", "-", "guided", "injections", "of", "therapeutic", "agents", "directly", "into", "the", "myocardium", ";", "the", "first", "simultaneous", "electrical", "and", "mechanical", "measurements", "of", "cardiac", "function", "with", "MR", ";", "and", "the", "first", "MR", "guided", "aortic", "valve", "replacement", "in", "the", "beating", "heart", ".", "Among", "his", "many", "achievements", ",", "Dr", ".", "McVeigh", "is", "an", "inventor", "on", "eight", "patents", "for", "real", "-", "time", "interventional", "MRI", "and", "real", "-", "time", "MRI", "devices", ",", "has", "published", "more", "than", "150", "peer", "-", "reviewed", "research", "papers", "and", "has", "mentored", "more", "than", "20", "graduate", "students", ".", "His", "vision", "for", "the", "Department", "of", "Biomedical", "Engineering", "is", "to", "produce", "new", "knowledge", "from", "stellar", "laboratories", "and", "promote", "the", "transfer", "of", "that", "knowledge", "into", "patient", "care", "at", "the", "fastest", "pace", "possible", "."], "record": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_0> title <extra_id_5> Professor <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> work for <extra_id_5> the Johns Hopkins Carey Business School . <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> gender <extra_id_5> His <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> highest education <extra_id_5> Ph .

Keywords : Discovery , isolation , and structure determination of new biologically active natural products from fungi ; anticancer agents ; antifungal agents ; natural insecticides ; fungal chemical ecology . Research Interests : Our research program is dedicated to the discovery , isolation , and structure determination of novel biologically active natural products from fungi . Many antibiotics , anticancer agents , and other important pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals in use today have been discovered through studies of the chemistry of bacteria and fungi . Our studies utilize observations in fungal ecology in order to target certain classes of fungi as logical sources of valuable new metabolites . Through these studies , we also seek to contribute to a better understanding of the roles of these compounds in the life cycles of the organisms that produce them . Current efforts in this area include studies of fungal metabolites involved in interspecies competition within natural ecosystems , and investigations of fungi that attack , colonize , and damage others as potential sources of antifungal agents . This research is interdisciplinary , and most of our projects involve collaboration with mycologists and colleagues from other neighboring disciplines . The process of discovering and isolating biologically active natural products is guided by assays that have pharmaceutical or agricultural relevance , including antifungal , antibacterial , antiinsectan , and anticancer screens . Some of these bioassays are carried out by our research group , while others are conducted by collaborating scientists . We employ a variety of chromatographic techniques , especially HPLC , in the analysis , isolation , and purification of compounds of interest . State - of - the - art methods for structure determination , such as high resolution mass spectrometry , high - field 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy , and 2D - NMR techniques are then applied to the solution of structural and stereochemical problems . Some representative new bioactive natural products discovered by our research group are shown in the accompanying figure . These metabolites exemplify the prolific biosynthetic capabilities of fungi , and include compounds with new ring systems and representatives of other rare structural classes .

{"text": "Serge Kaliaguine is Professor in the Department of Chemical Engineering at the University of Laval in Quebec , Canada . He has developed a strong expertise in the fields of zeolites and mesoporous molecular sieves and perovskites and other mixed oxides for which he developed a novel reactive grinding technology for industrial applications . He is also involved in the preparation of composite proton conducting membranes . Serge Kaliaguine is co - author of more than 300 peer - reviewed publications in the field of applied chemistry , chemical engineering and polymer chemistry . Based on the expertise built in our laboratory , the Chair research program comprises a series of projects aiming at the development of new materials with specific application objectives . At the same time , however , the scope of each project is broad enough that the properties of a large selection of materials are studied . This approach ensures a more documented optimization of the particular material selected for application , which is then thoroughly tested in realistic working conditions . This strategy makes it possible to gain a fundamental understanding of these properties , which is required since the formation of highly qualified personnel is also a goal . The Chair research program was established in order to fit the expected research needs of the industrial partners . The objective is to develop the research infrastructure and expertise of the laboratory in order to be , in future years , in a position to respond to the specific requirements of each of the partners . This program draws on the experience of the laboratory in the preparation and characterization of three different kinds of materials , namely : zeolites and mesoporous molecular sieves ( MMS ) , which has been a traditional strength in our research group ; perovskites and other mixed oxides for the synthesis of which the lab has developed an original technology of great industrial interest ; and composite proton conducting membranes . The Chair research program is , however , oriented toward the development of original applications for these materials . These applications may be divided into three different categories :", "tokens": ["Serge", "Kaliaguine", "is", "Professor", "in", "the", "Department", "of", "Chemical", "Engineering", "at", "the", "University", "of", "Laval", "in", "Quebec", ",", "Canada", ".", "He", "has", "developed", "a", "strong", "expertise", "in", "the", "fields", "of", "zeolites", "and", "mesoporous", "molecular", "sieves", "and", "perovskites", "and", "other", "mixed", "oxides", "for", "which", "he", "developed", "a", "novel", "reactive", "grinding", "technology", "for", "industrial", "applications", ".", "He", "is", "also", "involved", "in", "the", "preparation", "of", "composite", "proton", "conducting", "membranes", ".", "Serge", "Kaliaguine", "is", "co", "-", "author", "of", "more", "than", "300", "peer", "-", "reviewed", "publications", "in", "the", "field", "of", "applied", "chemistry", ",", "chemical", "engineering", "and", "polymer", "chemistry", ".", "Based", "on", "the", "expertise", "built", "in", "our", "laboratory", ",", "the", "Chair", "research", "program", "comprises", "a", "series", "of", "projects", "aiming", "at", "the", "development", "of", "new", "materials", "with", "specific", "application", "objectives", ".", "At", "the", "same", "time", ",", "however", ",", "the", "scope", "of", "each", "project", "is", "broad", "enough", "that", "the", "properties", "of", "a", "large", "selection", "of", "materials", "are", "studied", ".", "This", "approach", "ensures", "a", "more", "documented", "optimization", "of", "the", "particular", "material", "selected", "for", "application", ",", "which", "is", "then", "thoroughly", "tested", "in", "realistic", "working", "conditions", ".", "This", "strategy", "makes", "it", "possible", "to", "gain", "a", "fundamental", "understanding", "of", "these", "properties", ",", "which", "is", "required", "since", "the", "formation", "of", "highly", "qualified", "personnel", "is", "also", "a", "goal", ".", "The", "Chair", "research", "program", "was", "established", "in", "order", "to", "fit", "the", "expected", "research", "needs", "of", "the", "industrial", "partners", ".", "The", "objective", "is", "to", "develop", "the", "research", "infrastructure", "and", "expertise", "of", "the", "laboratory", "in", "order", "to", "be", ",", "in", "future", "years", ",", "in", "a", "position", "to", "respond", "to", "the", "specific", "requirements", "of", "each", "of", "the", "partners", ".", "This", "program", "draws", "on", "the", "experience", "of", "the", "laboratory", "in", "the", "preparation", "and", "characterization", "of", "three", "different", "kinds", "of", "materials", ",", "namely", ":", "zeolites", "and", "mesoporous", "molecular", "sieves", "(", "MMS", ")", ",", "which", "has", "been", "a", "traditional", "strength", "in", "our", "research", "group", ";", "perovskites", "and", "other", "mixed", "oxides", "for", "the", "synthesis", "of", "which", "the", "lab", "has", "developed", "an", "original", "technology", "of", "great", "industrial", "interest", ";", "and", "composite", "proton", "conducting", "membranes", ".", "The", "Chair", "research", "program", "is", ",", "however", ",", "oriented", "toward", "the", "development", "of", "original", "applications", "for", "these", "materials", ".", "These", "applications", "may", "be", "divided", "into", "three", "different", "categories", ":"], "record": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_0> title <extra_id_5> Professor <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> work for <extra_id_5> the University of Laval <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> gender <extra_id_5> He <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> research interests <extra_id_5> applied chemistry , chemical engineering and polymer chemistry <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1>", "entity": [{"type": "work for", "offset": [11, 12, 13, 14], "text": "the University of Laval"}, {"type": "title", "offset": [3], "text": "Professor"}, {"type": "gender", "offset": [20], "text": "He"}, {"type": "research interests", "offset": [85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92], "text": "applied chemistry , chemical engineering and polymer chemistry"}], "relation": [], "event": [], "spot": ["gender", "research interests", "work for", "title"], "asoc": [], "spot_asoc": [{"span": "Professor", "label": "title", "asoc": []}, {"span": "the University of Laval", "label": "work for", "asoc": []}, {"span": "He", "label": "gender", "asoc": []}, {"span": "applied chemistry , chemical engineering and polymer chemistry", "label": "research interests", "asoc": []}]}

{"text": "David Harold Bailey ( born 1948 ) is a mathematician and computer scientist . He received his B . S . in mathematics from Brigham Young University in 1972 and his Ph . D . in mathematics from Stanford University in 1976 . [ 1 ] He worked for 14 years as a computer scientist at NASA Ames Research Center , but since 1998 has been at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory . He is now officially retired , but continues as an active researcher . He is a Research Fellow at the University of California , Davis , Department of Computer Science . Bailey is perhaps best known as a co - author ( with Peter Borwein and Simon Plouffe ) of a 1997 paper that presented a new formula for ( pi ) . This BaileyBorweinPlouffe formula permits one to calculate binary or hexadecimal digits of pi beginning at an arbitrary position , by means of a simple algorithm . The formula was discovered by Simon Plouffe using a computer program written by Bailey . More recently ( 2001 and 2002 ) , Bailey and Richard Crandall showed that the existence of this and similar formulas has implications for the long - standing question of \" normality \" whether and why the digits of certain mathematical constants ( including pi ) appear \" random \" in a particular sense . Bailey is a long - time collaborator with Jonathan Borwein ( Peter ' s brother ) . They are co - authors of numerous papers and three books on experimental mathematics . Bailey also does research in numerical analysis and parallel computing . He has published studies on the fast Fourier transform , high - precision arithmetic , and the PSLQ algorithm ( used for integer relation detection ) . He is a co - author of the NAS Benchmarks , which are used to assess and analyze the performance of parallel scientific computers . He has also published articles in the area of mathematical finance , including a 2014 paper \" Pseudo - mathematics and financial charlatanism , \" which emphasizes the dangers of backtest overfitting in the financial field . In 1993 , Bailey received the Sidney Fernbach award from the IEEE Computer Society , as well as the Chauvenet Prize [ 2 ] and the Hasse Prize from the Mathematical Association of America . In 2005 he was a finalist for the $100 , 000 Edge of Computation Science Prize . In 2008 he was a co - recipient of the Gordon Bell Prize from the Association for Computing Machinery . In addition to Bailey ' s technical work in mathematics , computer science , Bailey has written articles on science and religion , emphasizing the pointlessness of war between science and religion . Bailey is the editor of the Science Meets Religion website , a repository of articles and information on issues at the juncture of science and religion . Bailey is affiliated with The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter - day Saints .", "tokens": ["David", "Harold", "Bailey", "(", "born", "1948", ")", "is", "a", "mathematician", "and", "computer", "scientist", ".", "He", "received", "his", "B", ".", "S", ".", "in", "mathematics", "from", "Brigham", "Young", "University", "in", "1972", "and", "his", "Ph", ".", "D", ".", "in", "mathematics", "from", "Stanford", "University", "in", "1976", ".", "[", "1", "]", "He", "worked", "for", "14", "years", "as", "a", "computer", "scientist", "at", "NASA", "Ames", "Research", "Center", ",", "but", "since", "1998", "has", "been", "at", "the", "Lawrence", "Berkeley", "National", "Laboratory", ".", "He", "is", "now", "officially", "retired", ",", "but", "continues", "as", "an", "active", "researcher", ".", "He", "is", "a", "Research", "Fellow", "at", "the", "University", "of", "California", ",", "Davis", ",", "Department", "of", "Computer", "Science", ".", "Bailey", "is", "perhaps", "best", "known", "as", "a", "co", "-", "author", "(", "with", "Peter", "Borwein", "and", "Simon", "Plouffe", ")", "of", "a", "1997", "paper", "that", "presented", "a", "new", "formula", "for", "(", "pi", ")", ".", "This", "BaileyBorweinPlouffe", "formula", "permits", "one", "to", "calculate", "binary", "or", "hexadecimal", "digits", "of", "pi", "beginning", "at", "an", "arbitrary", "position", ",", "by", "means", "of", "a", "simple", "algorithm", ".", "The", "formula", "was", "discovered", "by", "Simon", "Plouffe", "using", "a", "computer", "program", "written", "by", "Bailey", ".", "More", "recently", "(", "2001", "and", "2002", ")", ",", "Bailey", "and", "Richard", "Crandall", "showed", "that", "the", "existence", "of", "this", "and", "similar", "formulas", "has", "implications", "for", "the", "long", "-", "standing", "question", "of", "\"", "normality", "\"", "whether", "and", "why", "the", "digits", "of", "certain", "mathematical", "constants", "(", "including", "pi", ")", "appear", "\"", "random", "\"", "in", "a", "particular", "sense", ".", "Bailey", "is", "a", "long", "-", "time", "collaborator", "with", "Jonathan", "Borwein", "(", "Peter", "'", "s", "brother", ")", ".", "They", "are", "co", "-", "authors", "of", "numerous", "papers", "and", "three", "books", "on", "experimental", "mathematics", ".", "Bailey", "also", "does", "research", "in", "numerical", "analysis", "and", "parallel", "computing", ".", "He", "has", "published", "studies", "on", "the", "fast", "Fourier", "transform", ",", "high", "-", "precision", "arithmetic", ",", "and", "the", "PSLQ", "algorithm", "(", "used", "for", "integer", "relation", "detection", ")", ".", "He", "is", "a", "co", "-", "author", "of", "the", "NAS", "Benchmarks", ",", "which", "are", "used", "to", "assess", "and", "analyze", "the", "performance", "of", "parallel", "scientific", "computers", ".", "He", "has", "also", "published", "articles", "in", "the", "area", "of", "mathematical", "finance", ",", "including", "a", "2014", "paper", "\"", "Pseudo", "-", "mathematics", "and", "financial", "charlatanism", ",", "\"", "which", "emphasizes", "the", "dangers", "of", "backtest", "overfitting", "in", "the", "financial", "field", ".", "In", "1993", ",", "Bailey", "received", "the", "Sidney", "Fernbach", "award", "from", "the", "IEEE", "Computer", "Society", ",", "as", "well", "as", "the", "Chauvenet", "Prize", "[", "2", "]", "and", "the", "Hasse", "Prize", "from", "the", "Mathematical", "Association", "of", "America", ".", "In", "2005", "he", "was", "a", "finalist", "for", "the", "$100", ",", "000", "Edge", "of", "Computation", "Science", "Prize", ".", "In", "2008", "he", "was", "a", "co", "-", "recipient", "of", "the", "Gordon", "Bell", "Prize", "from", "the", "Association", "for", "Computing", "Machinery", ".", "In", "addition", "to", "Bailey", "'", "s", "technical", "work", "in", "mathematics", ",", "computer", "science", ",", "Bailey", "has", "written", "articles", "on", "science", "and", "religion", ",", "emphasizing", "the", "pointlessness", "of", "war", "between", "science", "and", "religion", ".", "Bailey", "is", "the", "editor", "of", "the", "Science", "Meets", "Religion", "website", ",", "a", "repository", "of", "articles", "and", "information", "on", "issues", "at", "the", "juncture", "of", "science", "and", "religion", ".", "Bailey", "is", "affiliated", "with", "The", "Church", "of", "Jesus", "Christ", "of", "Latter", "-", "day", "Saints", "."], "record": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_0> birthday <extra_id_5> 1948 <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> gender <extra_id_5> He <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> education <extra_id_5> He received his B .

{"text": "One of the central challenges of modern materials science is the ability to design and prepare functional materials starting from the atomic or molecular level . The materialization of this goal demands the discovery of new synthetic methods for the preparation of new nano - materials and discovery of new analytical tools with the help of which we may probe the structures of such nano - architectures . In recent years our scientific efforts were directed toward surface science . Our group has been among the pioneers in applying grazing incidence x - ray diffraction , using coherent x - rays from synchrotron sources , for analyzing the structure of crystallites of nanometer dimensions , formed at liquid interfaces . The ability to analyze the structures of these clusters on the molecular level allowed us to address a number of fundamental problems , that include the following : The induced nucleation of super - cooled water , by amphiphilic alcohols spread on drops of water Spontaneous resolution of racemates , in two - dimensions , at the air / water interface ; model systems for the origin of chirality on earth The monitoring of the early stages of crystallization of cholesterol , in relevance to the formation of gall - stones Design of synthetic auxiliary molecules for controlling crystal polymorphism , large - scale resolution of enantiomers by crystallization of materials of pharmaceutical interest , etc . Structural studies of the dynamics of ionophores ( molecules that transfer ions through biological membranes ) embedded within membrane - like materials , in relevance to the understanding of the mechanism of ion transfer via membranes Self - organization of molecules into multilayers at the interface , en route to crystal formation Organometallic supramolecular architectures formed at interfaces and their inter - conversion into superlattices of quantum particles ; the latter materials should display unique opto - electronic properties Organization of the molecules at the air / solid interface and the role played by molecules of the environment on crystal growth Selected Publications : \" Achiral Organic , Inorganic , and Metal Crystals as Auxiliaries for Asymmetric Transformations \" Isabelle Weissbuch , Leslie Leiserowitz , and Meir Lahav Isr .

{"text": "Conrad Elvehjem , the son of Norwegian emigrants to Wisconsin , was born in McFarland , Wisconsin . He progressed through the secondary schools and the University of Wisconsin , where he received his PhD in 1927 with mentor E . B . Hart for his studies of the importance of copper in iron - deficiency anemia . A National Research Council fellowship permitted a year at Cambridge University in England . Elvehjem began teaching in agricultural chemistry at the University of Wisconsin in 1923 , and became a full professor in 1936 . He became chairman of the biochemistry department in 1944 and dean of the graduate school in 1946 , at 45 years of age . He served as dean of the graduate school until he became university ' s 13th president in 1958 . Picking up on the work of Joseph Goldberger , he found that nicotinic acid cured black tongue in dogs , an analogous disease to pellagra . In the previous year , Elvehjem and his colleague Carl J . Koehn had found that a filtrate factor from a liver extract could cure diet - induced pellagra in chicks . That filtrate extract was designated as the vitamin G fraction , after the late Goldberger . To confirm their findings in dogs , they induced black tongue in these animals with the Goldberger diet of yellow corn , before supplementing the diet with the vitamin G fraction . Elvehjem and his colleagues later were able to isolate and identify nicotinamide and nictonic acid from vitamin G as the curative factors for black tongue in dogs . He also contributed greatly to the identification of vitamin B complex and was co - author of more than 780 scientific papers on biochemistry and nutrition . In 1952 , Elvehjem was awarded the Albert Lasker Award for clinical medical research . He received the Willard Gibbs Medal in 1943 . Elvehjem commented frequently on nutrition as it affects both scientist and layman . \" Vitamins should be obtained from natural foods if possible , \" he cautioned . \" Generally they are cheaper , more palatable , and in better balance with other factors when taken in this form . \" He acknowledged the value of synthetic vitamins in treating deficiency diseases , but warned that their use should be temporary . Elvehjems first graduate student ( in 1931 ) was noted nutritionist Fredrick John Stare who later founded and chaired the department of nutrition at the Harvard School of Public Health , where he served until 1976 . Elvehjem met his wife Constance W . Elvehjem when she was an undergraduate at UW Madison . She died in 1999 at the age of 94 after many years supporting the museum and the Madison community .", "tokens": ["Conrad", "Elvehjem", ",", "the", "son", "of", "Norwegian", "emigrants", "to", "Wisconsin", ",", "was", "born", "in", "McFarland", ",", "Wisconsin", ".", "He", "progressed", "through", "the", "secondary", "schools", "and", "the", "University", "of", "Wisconsin", ",", "where", "he", "received", "his", "PhD", "in", "1927", "with", "mentor", "E", ".", "B", ".", "Hart", "for", "his", "studies", "of", "the", "importance", "of", "copper", "in", "iron", "-", "deficiency", "anemia", ".", "A", "National", "Research", "Council", "fellowship", "permitted", "a", "year", "at", "Cambridge", "University", "in", "England", ".", "Elvehjem", "began", "teaching", "in", "agricultural", "chemistry", "at", "the", "University", "of", "Wisconsin", "in", "1923", ",", "and", "became", "a", "full", "professor", "in", "1936", ".", "He", "became", "chairman", "of", "the", "biochemistry", "department", "in", "1944", "and", "dean", "of", "the", "graduate", "school", "in", "1946", ",", "at", "45", "years", "of", "age", ".", "He", "served", "as", "dean", "of", "the", "graduate", "school", "until", "he", "became", "university", "'", "s", "13th", "president", "in", "1958", ".", "Picking", "up", "on", "the", "work", "of", "Joseph", "Goldberger", ",", "he", "found", "that", "nicotinic", "acid", "cured", "black", "tongue", "in", "dogs", ",", "an", "analogous", "disease", "to", "pellagra", ".", "In", "the", "previous", "year", ",", "Elvehjem", "and", "his", "colleague", "Carl", "J", ".", "Koehn", "had", "found", "that", "a", "filtrate", "factor", "from", "a", "liver", "extract", "could", "cure", "diet", "-", "induced", "pellagra", "in", "chicks", ".", "That", "filtrate", "extract", "was", "designated", "as", "the", "vitamin", "G", "fraction", ",", "after", "the", "late", "Goldberger", ".", "To", "confirm", "their", "findings", "in", "dogs", ",", "they", "induced", "black", "tongue", "in", "these", "animals", "with", "the", "Goldberger", "diet", "of", "yellow", "corn", ",", "before", "supplementing", "the", "diet", "with", "the", "vitamin", "G", "fraction", ".", "Elvehjem", "and", "his", "colleagues", "later", "were", "able", "to", "isolate", "and", "identify", "nicotinamide", "and", "nictonic", "acid", "from", "vitamin", "G", "as", "the", "curative", "factors", "for", "black", "tongue", "in", "dogs", ".", "He", "also", "contributed", "greatly", "to", "the", "identification", "of", "vitamin", "B", "complex", "and", "was", "co", "-", "author", "of", "more", "than", "780", "scientific", "papers", "on", "biochemistry", "and", "nutrition", ".", "In", "1952", ",", "Elvehjem", "was", "awarded", "the", "Albert", "Lasker", "Award", "for", "clinical", "medical", "research", ".", "He", "received", "the", "Willard", "Gibbs", "Medal", "in", "1943", ".", "Elvehjem", "commented", "frequently", "on", "nutrition", "as", "it", "affects", "both", "scientist", "and", "layman", ".", "\"", "Vitamins", "should", "be", "obtained", "from", "natural", "foods", "if", "possible", ",", "\"", "he", "cautioned", ".", "\"", "Generally", "they", "are", "cheaper", ",", "more", "palatable", ",", "and", "in", "better", "balance", "with", "other", "factors", "when", "taken", "in", "this", "form", ".", "\"", "He", "acknowledged", "the", "value", "of", "synthetic", "vitamins", "in", "treating", "deficiency", "diseases", ",", "but", "warned", "that", "their", "use", "should", "be", "temporary", ".", "Elvehjems", "first", "graduate", "student", "(", "in", "1931", ")", "was", "noted", "nutritionist", "Fredrick", "John", "Stare", "who", "later", "founded", "and", "chaired", "the", "department", "of", "nutrition", "at", "the", "Harvard", "School", "of", "Public", "Health", ",", "where", "he", "served", "until", "1976", ".", "Elvehjem", "met", "his", "wife", "Constance", "W", ".", "Elvehjem", "when", "she", "was", "an", "undergraduate", "at", "UW", "Madison", ".", "She", "died", "in", "1999", "at", "the", "age", "of", "94", "after", "many", "years", "supporting", "the", "museum", "and", "the", "Madison", "community", "."], "record": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_0> birth place <extra_id_5> McFarland , Wisconsin <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> gender <extra_id_5> He <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> education <extra_id_5> He progressed through the secondary schools and the University of Wisconsin , where he received his PhD in 1927 with mentor E .

{"text": "Henry David is one of the distinguished early leaders in the field of reproductive health and freedom . As a clinical psychologist , Henry became acquainted with Christopher Tietze in Geneva , Switzerland while working as Associate Director for the World Federation for Mental Health from 1963 - 1965 . At that time , Henry and Christopher Tietze developed a plan for studying the mental health effects of abortion in Central and Eastern Europe where abortion was legal . Henry later developed and directed the Prague Study of children born in 1961 - 63 to women twice denied abortion for the same pregnancy and pair - matched controls . This has become one of the most important single studies in the world literature of the mental health consequences of abortion and abortion denied . Henrys work is classic and historic . For over 30 years , Henry David focused increasingly on studies of reproductive behavior and public policies , particularly in Central and Eastern Europe . He has written or edited 17 books and authored or co - authored over 300 papers . His work has been honored by numerous awards including the 1991 Medal of Charles University ( Prague ) , the 1993 American Psychological Association Award for Distinguished Contributions to the International Advancement of Psychology , the 2001 Gold Medal for Lifetime Achievement in Psychology in the Public Interest , the 2001 Carl Shultz Award of the American Public Health Association , and the 2001 Gold Shield of the Population and Community Development Association of Thailand .

{"text": "My research program centers around spatial vision and involves the use of behavioral , oculomotor , electrophysiological and functional MRI techniques in humans . My research has focused for many years on normal visual development as well as abnormal visual development in patients with strabismus , autism and cortical visual impairment . To inform this work , I also work with normal adults and animal models . I have published over 30 papers on the normal developmental process , the first in 1977 . In addition , I have published over 30 papers on abnormal visual development over the last 20 years and am an expert in the diagnostic classification and pathophysiology of disorders of binocular vision and developmental disorders . I am thus in a position to translate basic science results into clinical applications . My laboratory has established numerous paradigms in which Visual Evoked Potentials have been used as objective measures of sensory and cognitive function . My group has published many papers in which we have related perceptual judgments to human brain activity . We have developed multiple generations of sophisticated and flexible instrumentation that we have shared with many other laboratories . Central to our research program is our unique integration of functional MRI and high - density EEG source imaging that allows us to relate brain electrical activity to identified visual areas with 1 - 2 cm accuracy in individual participants . The development of this technique involved the creation and management of a diverse team of experts in functional MRI , physics , biomedical engineering and visual physiology .

{"text": "Diana W . Bianchi is an American medical geneticist and neonatologist noted for her research on fetal cell microchimerism and prenatal testing . Bianchi is currently the Natalie V . Zucker Professor of Pediatrics , Obstetrics , and Gynecology at Tufts University School of Medicine and Executive Director of the Mother Infant Research Institute at Tufts Medical Center . She is also Vice Chair for Research in the Department of Pediatrics at the Floating Hospital for Children at Tufts Medical Center . Bianchi grew up in New York City . She earned a B . A . from University of Pennsylvania and an M . D . from Stanford University School of Medicine . While at Stanford she performed her doctoral research with Leonard Herzenberg , Ph . D . , studying the use of flow cytometry to develop a noninvasive cytogenetic prenatal diagnostic test for Down syndrome . One of Herzenbergs children had Down syndrome , so the project had both scientific and personal significance for her mentor . [ 1 ] She completed her postdoctoral work at Boston Childrens Hospital and Harvard Medical School . She is a member of the Clinical Advisory Board of Verinata Health , an Illumina company . [ 2 ] Bianchi is one of four authors of the book Fetology : Diagnosis and Management of the Fetal Patient . [ 3 ] This book won the Association of American Publishers award for the best textbook in clinical medicine in 2000 . Bianchi joined the faculty at Harvard University in 1986 , concurrently assuming a position as an attending neonatologist and geneticist at Boston Childrens Hospital . In 1993 , Bianchi left to take a position at Tufts University School of Medicine , receiving an endowed chair in 2002 . In 2007 , Bianchi became Editor - in - Chief of Prenatal Diagnosis , the official journal of the International Society for Prenatal Diagnosis . [ 4 ] In 2010 , she founded the Mother Infant Research Institute ( MIRI ) at Tufts Medical Center , assuming the position of Executive Director . [ 5 ] Bianchi worked for many years on developing methods to isolate intact fetal cells from maternal blood as a noninvasive way to obtain fetal material for genetic diagnosis . While the work proved challenging due to the relative rarity of the fetal cells in the mothers blood , the research led to an unexpected finding . Bianchi discovered that intact fetal cells remain in the mother ' s blood and organs for decades following pregnancy , with the possibility of migrating to the site of an injury in the mother , dividing and changing into the cells needed to fix the problem .

{"text": "Neil E . Kay , M . D . , is a Professor of Medicine at the Mayo Clinic College of Medicine and a Consultant in the Department of Internal Medicine , Division of Hematology at Mayo Clinic in Rochester , Minnesota . Dr . Kay received his medical degree from the University of Manitoba Medical School in Winnipeg , Manitoba , Canada . He is board certified in Internal Medicine and Hematology . Dr . Kay is a member of the American Society of Hematology , the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group , and the National Cancer Institute ' s Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia Research Consortium . Dr . Kay ' s primary area of interest is in the biological pathogenesis of Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia and has been working on this aspect for more than 30 years . His work has led to the refinement of CLL prognostic staging indicators using molecular biologic and genetic techniques to more accurately determine individual patient outcomes and promising therapeutic agents to treat the disease . His work , and the work of others , has advanced the ability to counsel CLL patients about their risk of progression . These advances are more relevant to our understanding of the disease and have helped in the development of some unique treatment options . Treatment options arising from this work include , use of epigallocatechin - 3 gallate ( EGCG ) a chemical found in green tea which appears to block VEGF from binding and is now in clinical trials for use in early stage CLL ; or use of combination chemoimmunotherapy regimens such as pentostatin , cyclophosphamide and rituximab ( PCR ) ; or PCR plus other agents such as anti - VEGF antibodies ( bevacizumab or revlimid ) . More recently he and his team at Mayo are working on the development of mimicking the microenvironment in the laboratory setting so as to better study the impact of drugs and other agents on the survival of CLL B - cells . In this way there will be a more realistic approach to determining efficacy of single or combination agents in the treatment of CLL patients . Dr .

{"text": "I am currently Chair of Radiation Oncology at St . Jude Childrens Research Hospital in Memphis , Tennessee where I have practiced since 1996 . Prior to my appointment at St . Jude , I was an attending physician in the Department of Radiation Oncology at the Memorial Sloan - Kettering Cancer Center in New York , New York . I was originally trained as a nuclear engineer at the University of Michigan . After completing my engineering degree , and prior to attending medical school at the Chicago College of Osteopathic Medicine , I worked in the area of radiation protection and safety for the French Atomic Energy Commission in Fontenay - aux - Roses , France . After medical school , I was a Fulbright Scholar to the Netherlands at the University of Utrecht where I received my Ph . D . , cum laude , in experimental pathology . I interned at the Chicago Osteopathic Hospital and performed my residency at the Memorial Sloan - Kettering Cancer Center . As a part of my formal medical and residency training , I spent time at the Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary in Boston and Curie Institute in Paris . In the latter part of my residency training , I was awarded a fellowship and spent time at the Joint Center for Radiation Therapy and Childrens Hospital Boston . The subject of my research has been the application of advanced radiotherapy methods in the treatment of children with cancer . My focus has been in pediatric neuro - oncology where I have designed new treatments for children with brain tumors and modeled radiation - related CNS effects . The broad long - term goal of my research has been to increase the cure rates for the most common brain tumors and reduce or eliminate the side effects of radiation therapy . My work in the area of conformal radiation therapy for pediatric CNS tumors has provided the basis for the dose , volume and normal tissue tolerance guidelines used in most of the national cooperative group brain tumor trials for children with medulloblastoma , ependymoma , low - grade glioma and craniopharyngioma . My work has recently been highlighted in a number of oncology journals including Lancet Oncology , Journal of Clinical Oncology , and the International Journal of Radiation Oncology , Biology and Physics .", "tokens": ["I", "am", "currently", "Chair", "of", "Radiation", "Oncology", "at", "St", ".", "Jude", "Childrens", "Research", "Hospital", "in", "Memphis", ",", "Tennessee", "where", "I", "have", "practiced", "since", "1996", ".", "Prior", "to", "my", "appointment", "at", "St", ".", "Jude", ",", "I", "was", "an", "attending", "physician", "in", "the", "Department", "of", "Radiation", "Oncology", "at", "the", "Memorial", "Sloan", "-", "Kettering", "Cancer", "Center", "in", "New", "York", ",", "New", "York", ".", "I", "was", "originally", "trained", "as", "a", "nuclear", "engineer", "at", "the", "University", "of", "Michigan", ".", "After", "completing", "my", "engineering", "degree", ",", "and", "prior", "to", "attending", "medical", "school", "at", "the", "Chicago", "College", "of", "Osteopathic", "Medicine", ",", "I", "worked", "in", "the", "area", "of", "radiation", "protection", "and", "safety", "for", "the", "French", "Atomic", "Energy", "Commission", "in", "Fontenay", "-", "aux", "-", "Roses", ",", "France", ".", "After", "medical", "school", ",", "I", "was", "a", "Fulbright", "Scholar", "to", "the", "Netherlands", "at", "the", "University", "of", "Utrecht", "where", "I", "received", "my", "Ph", ".", "D", ".", ",", "cum", "laude", ",", "in", "experimental", "pathology", ".", "I", "interned", "at", "the", "Chicago", "Osteopathic", "Hospital", "and", "performed", "my", "residency", "at", "the", "Memorial", "Sloan", "-", "Kettering", "Cancer", "Center", ".", "As", "a", "part", "of", "my", "formal", "medical", "and", "residency", "training", ",", "I", "spent", "time", "at", "the", "Massachusetts", "Eye", "and", "Ear", "Infirmary", "in", "Boston", "and", "Curie", "Institute", "in", "Paris", ".", "In", "the", "latter", "part", "of", "my", "residency", "training", ",", "I", "was", "awarded", "a", "fellowship", "and", "spent", "time", "at", "the", "Joint", "Center", "for", "Radiation", "Therapy", "and", "Childrens", "Hospital", "Boston", ".", "The", "subject", "of", "my", "research", "has", "been", "the", "application", "of", "advanced", "radiotherapy", "methods", "in", "the", "treatment", "of", "children", "with", "cancer", ".", "My", "focus", "has", "been", "in", "pediatric", "neuro", "-", "oncology", "where", "I", "have", "designed", "new", "treatments", "for", "children", "with", "brain", "tumors", "and", "modeled", "radiation", "-", "related", "CNS", "effects", ".", "The", "broad", "long", "-", "term", "goal", "of", "my", "research", "has", "been", "to", "increase", "the", "cure", "rates", "for", "the", "most", "common", "brain", "tumors", "and", "reduce", "or", "eliminate", "the", "side", "effects", "of", "radiation", "therapy", ".", "My", "work", "in", "the", "area", "of", "conformal", "radiation", "therapy", "for", "pediatric", "CNS", "tumors", "has", "provided", "the", "basis", "for", "the", "dose", ",", "volume", "and", "normal", "tissue", "tolerance", "guidelines", "used", "in", "most", "of", "the", "national", "cooperative", "group", "brain", "tumor", "trials", "for", "children", "with", "medulloblastoma", ",", "ependymoma", ",", "low", "-", "grade", "glioma", "and", "craniopharyngioma", ".", "My", "work", "has", "recently", "been", "highlighted", "in", "a", "number", "of", "oncology", "journals", "including", "Lancet", "Oncology", ",", "Journal", "of", "Clinical", "Oncology", ",", "and", "the", "International", "Journal", "of", "Radiation", "Oncology", ",", "Biology", "and", "Physics", "."], "record": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_0> title <extra_id_5> Chair <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> work for <extra_id_5> St .

{"text": "Michael Von Korff has carried out groundbreaking research on the management and outcomes of chronic pain , depression , and other illnesses in primary care settings . His work as an epidemiologist and health services researcher focuses on understanding how patients adapt to chronic illnesses associated with pain and psychological distress , including how they use health care services , medicines , and cope with illness in their daily lives . Dr . Von Korff has co - led major randomized trials examining various approaches to chronic illness management in primary care , including collaborative care for depression and interventions to improve self - care of chronic - recurrent back pain . A major focus throughout his career has been studying mental - physical comorbidity and how patients manage distressing physical symptoms . This research has included a series of longitudinal studies of disability and health care use among primary care patients with depression , back pain , headache , and other chronic pain conditions . More recently , his research has focused on trends and risks of long - term prescription of opioids for chronic non - cancer pain . In January 2010 , Dr . Von Korff and colleagues published the first study on overdose risk by dose among patients receiving prescribed opioids for chronic non - cancer pain . That study , published in the Annals of Internal Medicine , linked higher risk of fatal and nonfatal overdose to higher daily dose prescribed . His research also showed that Group Health , like other health systems nationwide , had been prescribing more opioids for chronic non - cancer pain over timea twofold increase from 1997 to 2005 . His research on opioids was funded by grants from the National Institute on Drug Abuse and the National Institute on Aging . Recognizing the importance of the organization of care in shaping safe opioid prescribing practices , Group Healths Chief of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Randi Beck , MD , partnered with Dr . Von Korff to implement new approaches to opioid risk reduction , including an online clinician education course , Changing Chronic Pain Management & Use of Opioids , which explains Group Healths guidelines on opioid prescribing . Funded by a Partnership for Innovation grant from the Group Health Foundation , the course aims to help primary care providers implement recommended practice changes . Substantial change in opioid management was achieved through guideline implementation . Dr . Von Korff recently received significant funding from the Patient - Centered Outcomes Research Institute to evaluate the effects of these practice changes on patient pain outcomes and opioid - related adverse events . Dr . Von Korff has published more than 350 papers in peer - reviewed journals on chronic pain , mental health , chronic illness , and disability . In 1997 , he was selected as a fellow of AcademyHealth and of the Society of Behavioral Medicine . In 2002 , the Institute for Scientific Information recognized him as one of the nations most highly cited scientists in psychiatry and behavioral sciences . He has served as an advisor to major World Health Organization initiatives related to disability and mental health . He also served as GHRIs Associate Director for Research from 1992 to 1996 and again from 1999 to 2005 .", "tokens": ["Michael", "Von", "Korff", "has", "carried", "out", "groundbreaking", "research",

{"text": "Underwood was born on February 28 , 1915 , in Center Point , Iowa . He received his primary and secondary education in Albion , a small town serving the farming community in central Iowa , where his father owned and operated the local lumberyard . His mother was particularly supportive of her children ' s education , providing each with the opportunity to take special music lessons and expressing great admiration for a new idea , a well - written theme , or a good set of grades . She was particularly proud when Underwood published a short piece in the local paper on the history of Albion . Upon graduating from high school in 1932 , Underwood hoped to become a high - school athletic coach - - a position viewed locally , in Underwood ' s words , \" as being little short of aristocratic . \" With the help of a scholarship , personal loans , and room - and - board jobs , Underwood attended Cornell College in Mount Vernon , Iowa , and graduated in 1936 with majors in education and psychology . After graduation , he found a temporary teaching job in the high school in Clarion , Iowa , and then , a year later , realized his long - term dream by serving for two years as a junior college athletic coach and a part - time academic teacher in Tipton , Iowa . He decided to further his education when he realized that \" it was of much greater interest and challenge to teach an academic subject to reluctant minds than to try to teach a pivot shot to would - be athletes lacking in basic coordination . \" With his new bride , Louise Olson Underwood , the couple headed west , where he planned to enroll in the summer session of 1939 at the University of Oregon . Underwood was experiencing difficulty in choosing between graduate work in education or in psychology , which was resolved when he took a psychology course offered by John Dashiell , who was a visiting professor from the University of North Carolina . After a few weeks in this course , Underwood made the decision to dedicate himself to a career in psychology . Late that summer , Underwood accepted a position as a research assistant to Arthur W . Melton , chairman of the Psychology Department at the University of Missouri . Under Melton ' s guidance , Underwood discovered the importance of applying experimental techniques to understand behavior and the excitement of research in Melton ' s field , verbal learning and memory , the study of which would occupy his entire professional life .", "tokens": ["Underwood", "was", "born", "on", "February", "28", ",", "1915", ",", "in", "Center", "Point", ",", "Iowa", ".", "He", "received", "his", "primary", "and", "secondary", "education", "in", "Albion", ",", "a", "small", "town", "serving", "the", "farming", "community", "in", "central", "Iowa", ",", "where", "his", "father", "owned", "and", "operated", "the", "local", "lumberyard", ".", "His", "mother", "was", "particularly", "supportive", "of", "her", "children", "'", "s", "education", ",", "providing", "each", "with", "the", "opportunity", "to", "take", "special", "music", "lessons", "and", "expressing", "great", "admiration", "for", "a", "new", "idea", ",", "a", "well", "-", "written", "theme", ",", "or", "a", "good", "set", "of", "grades", ".", "She", "was", "particularly", "proud", "when", "Underwood", "published", "a", "short", "piece", "in", "the", "local", "paper", "on", "the", "history", "of", "Albion", ".", "Upon", "graduating", "from", "high", "school", "in", "1932", ",", "Underwood", "hoped", "to", "become", "a", "high", "-", "school", "athletic", "coach", "-", "-", "a", "position", "viewed", "locally", ",", "in", "Underwood", "'", "s", "words", ",", "\"", "as", "being", "little", "short", "of", "aristocratic", ".", "\"", "With", "the", "help", "of", "a", "scholarship", ",", "personal", "loans", ",", "and", "room", "-", "and", "-", "board", "jobs", ",", "Underwood", "attended", "Cornell", "College", "in", "Mount", "Vernon", ",", "Iowa", ",", "and", "graduated", "in", "1936", "with", "majors", "in", "education", "and", "psychology", ".", "After", "graduation", ",", "he", "found", "a", "temporary", "teaching", "job", "in", "the", "high", "school", "in", "Clarion", ",", "Iowa", ",", "and", "then", ",", "a", "year", "later", ",", "realized", "his", "long", "-", "term", "dream", "by", "serving", "for", "two", "years", "as", "a", "junior", "college", "athletic", "coach", "and", "a", "part", "-", "time", "academic", "teacher", "in", "Tipton", ",", "Iowa", ".", "He", "decided", "to", "further", "his", "education", "when", "he", "realized", "that", "\"", "it", "was", "of", "much", "greater", "interest", "and", "challenge", "to", "teach", "an", "academic", "subject", "to", "reluctant", "minds", "than", "to", "try", "to", "teach", "a", "pivot", "shot", "to", "would", "-", "be", "athletes", "lacking", "in", "basic", "coordination", ".", "\"", "With", "his", "new", "bride", ",", "Louise", "Olson", "Underwood", ",", "the", "couple", "headed", "west", ",", "where", "he", "planned", "to", "enroll", "in", "the", "summer", "session", "of", "1939", "at", "the", "University", "of", "Oregon", ".", "Underwood", "was", "experiencing", "difficulty", "in", "choosing", "between", "graduate", "work", "in", "education", "or", "in", "psychology", ",", "which", "was", "resolved", "when", "he", "took", "a", "psychology", "course", "offered", "by", "John", "Dashiell", ",", "who", "was", "a", "visiting", "professor", "from", "the", "University", "of", "North", "Carolina", ".", "After", "a", "few", "weeks", "in", "this", "course", ",", "Underwood", "made", "the", "decision", "to", "dedicate", "himself", "to", "a", "career", "in", "psychology", ".", "Late", "that", "summer", ",", "Underwood", "accepted", "a", "position", "as", "a", "research", "assistant", "to", "Arthur", "W", ".", "Melton", ",", "chairman", "of", "the", "Psychology", "Department", "at", "the", "University", "of", "Missouri", ".", "Under", "Melton", "'", "s", "guidance", ",", "Underwood", "discovered", "the", "importance", "of", "applying", "experimental", "techniques", "to", "understand", "behavior", "and", "the", "excitement", "of", "research", "in", "Melton", "'", "s", "field", ",", "verbal", "learning", "and", "memory", ",", "the", "study", "of", "which", "would", "occupy", "his", "entire", "professional", "life", "."], "record": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_0> birthday <extra_id_5> February 28 , 1915 <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> birth place <extra_id_5> Center Point , Iowa <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> gender <extra_id_5> He <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> education <extra_id_5> With the help of a scholarship , personal loans , and room -

{"text": "I am primarily a theoretician , but also engage with relevant experiment . A long - standing interest has been in electron ( or more generally , charge ) transferin chemical systems , The kinetics of simple isotopic exchange reactions such as Fe * 2+ / Fe3+ can be understood in terms of diabatic energy surfaces generated through electron - vibrational interaction ( lambda ) coupled through electronic interaction ( J ) to produce Born - Oppenheimer adiabatic surfaces . This two - site model for the ground state can be generalized to describe any donor - acceptor charge transfer . The vibronic coupling lambda can be to any number of internal modes ( e . g . 100 in the bacterial photosynthetic radical cation ) and medium ( solution or crystal ) modes . In the more general case where donor and acceptor are different species , there is an overall energy offset Eo to consider . In general , an optical transition to the upper adiabatic surface ( ' intervalence transfer ' ) is allowed ( giving rise to typical strong colours of mixed - valence systems ) permitting values of the parameters lambda ( and its individual contributions ) ) J and Eo to be deduced . Where donor and acceptor are linked through a bridging molecule , electronic properties depend critically on the ratio of J to lambda / 2 , ranging from kinetically localized to single - minimum maximally quantum - entangled delocalized in the case of molecules , and from charge density wave through spin density wave to metallic behaviour in the solid state as the ratio approaches or surpasses unity . This coupled diabatic approach links in , for example , with general theories of chemical reaction dynamics , proton transfer , aromaticity and umbrella - type inversion ( e . g . in ammonia ) . This work has progressed naturally to Molecular Electronics , where conduction through molecular wires linked to nanoelectrodes , principally ballistic but modulated by vibronic coupling , is considered . The dependence of conductivity and quantum interference effects on the structure of the molecular wire and details of links to the metal interfaces raise analogous problems . In this work , detailed quantum chemical calculations are needed , particularly to interpret Scanning Tunnelling Microscope and allied images . This connects with my long - standing interest in calculation of molecular properties , particularly response functions such as electronic and vibrational Stark effects .", "tokens": ["I", "am", "primarily", "a", "theoretician", ",", "but", "also", "engage", "with", "relevant", "experiment", ".", "A", "long", "-", "standing", "interest", "has", "been", "in", "electron", "(", "or", "more", "generally", ",", "charge", ")", "transferin", "chemical", "systems", ",", "The", "kinetics", "of", "simple", "isotopic", "exchange", "reactions", "such", "as", "Fe", "*", "2+", "/", "Fe3+", "can", "be", "understood", "in", "terms", "of", "diabatic", "energy", "surfaces", "generated", "through", "electron", "-", "vibrational", "interaction", "(", "lambda", ")", "coupled", "through", "electronic", "interaction", "(", "J", ")", "to", "produce", "Born", "-", "Oppenheimer", "adiabatic", "surfaces", ".", "This", "two", "-", "site", "model", "for", "the", "ground", "state", "can", "be", "generalized", "to", "describe", "any", "donor", "-", "acceptor", "charge", "transfer", ".", "The", "vibronic", "coupling", "lambda", "can", "be", "to", "any", "number", "of", "internal", "modes", "(", "e", ".", "g", ".", "100", "in", "the", "bacterial", "photosynthetic", "radical", "cation", ")", "and", "medium", "(", "solution", "or", "crystal", ")", "modes", ".", "In", "the", "more", "general", "case", "where", "donor", "and", "acceptor", "are", "different", "species", ",", "there", "is", "an", "overall", "energy", "offset", "Eo", "to", "consider", ".", "In", "general", ",", "an", "optical", "transition", "to", "the", "upper", "adiabatic", "surface", "(", "'", "intervalence", "transfer", "'", ")", "is", "allowed", "(", "giving", "rise", "to", "typical", "strong", "colours", "of", "mixed", "-", "valence", "systems", ")", "permitting", "values", "of", "the", "parameters", "lambda", "(", "and", "its", "individual", "contributions", ")", ")", "J", "and", "Eo", "to", "be", "deduced", ".", "Where", "donor", "and", "acceptor", "are", "linked", "through", "a", "bridging", "molecule", ",", "electronic", "properties", "depend", "critically", "on", "the", "ratio", "of", "J", "to", "lambda", "/", "2", ",", "ranging", "from", "kinetically", "localized", "to", "single", "-", "minimum", "maximally", "quantum", "-", "entangled", "delocalized", "in", "the", "case", "of", "molecules", ",", "and", "from", "charge", "density", "wave", "through", "spin", "density", "wave", "to", "metallic", "behaviour", "in", "the", "solid", "state", "as", "the", "ratio", "approaches", "or", "surpasses", "unity", ".", "This", "coupled", "diabatic", "approach", "links", "in", ",", "for", "example", ",", "with", "general", "theories", "of", "chemical", "reaction", "dynamics", ",", "proton", "transfer", ",", "aromaticity", "and", "umbrella", "-", "type", "inversion", "(", "e", ".", "g", ".", "in", "ammonia", ")", ".", "This", "work", "has", "progressed", "naturally", "to", "Molecular", "Electronics", ",", "where", "conduction", "through", "molecular", "wires", "linked", "to", "nanoelectrodes", ",", "principally", "ballistic", "but", "modulated", "by", "vibronic", "coupling", ",", "is", "considered", ".", "The", "dependence", "of", "conductivity", "and", "quantum", "interference", "effects", "on", "the", "structure", "of", "the", "molecular", "wire", "and", "details", "of", "links", "to", "the", "metal", "interfaces", "raise", "analogous", "problems", ".", "In", "this", "work", ",", "detailed", "quantum", "chemical", "calculations", "are", "needed", ",", "particularly", "to", "interpret", "Scanning", "Tunnelling", "Microscope", "and", "allied", "images", ".", "This", "connects", "with", "my", "long", "-", "standing", "interest", "in", "calculation", "of", "molecular", "properties", ",", "particularly", "response", "functions", "such", "as", "electronic", "and", "vibrational", "Stark", "effects", "."], "record": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_0> research interests <extra_id_5> electron ( or more generally , charge ) transferin chemical systems <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1>", "entity": [{"type": "research interests", "offset": [21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31], "text": "electron ( or more generally , charge ) transferin chemical systems"}], "relation": [], "event": [], "spot": ["research interests"], "asoc": [], "spot_asoc": [{"span": "electron ( or more generally , charge ) transferin chemical systems", "label": "research interests", "asoc": []}]}

{"text": "Assembly and signal transduction of the T cell receptor for antigen . To examine the role of the CD3 genes in thymocyte development and in T cell function we study mice in which the CD3 genes have been eliminated by homologous recombination techniques . In addition , the mechanisms that govern expresion of the three CD3 genes in early T cells are being studied . The gene which is aberrant in X - linked lymphoproliferative syndrome ( XLP ) ( SAP / SH2D1A ) has been cloned and its protein crystal structure solved . At least two sets of target molecules for this small SH2 domain - containing protein have been identified : one family of hematopoietic cell surface receptors , i . e . the SLAM family , and a second molecule , which is a phosphorylated adapter . A SAP - like molecule , EAT - 2 , has also been found to interact with this family of surface receptors . Several lines of evidence , including analyses of missense mutations in XLP patients , support the notion that SAP / SH2D1A is a natural blocker of SH2 - domain dependent interactions with members of the SLAM family . However , details of its role in signaling mechanisms are yet to be unravelled . Virus infections of a mouse in which the SAP / SH2D1A gene has been disrupted suggest that EBV infection is not per se critical for the development of XLP phenotypes . It appears that the SAP / SH2D1A gene plays a more fundamental role in T cell and APC interactions by controlling the signaling of SLAM family surface receptors and through a set of adapter molecules . Animal models of Inflammatory Bowel Disease . Three models for experimental enterocolitis are used in the lab , two are based on cell transfer technology and a third uses the IL - 2null mouse crossed with the b2m null mouse . These systems permit a rapid analysis of the role of mutant T cells and the effect of specific inhibitors of T cell functions in vivo . Thus , we are able to dissect the pathways that lead to induction of colitis , which will set the stage for development of novel therapeutic agents .", "tokens": ["Assembly", "and", "signal", "transduction", "of", "the", "T", "cell", "receptor", "for", "antigen", ".", "To", "examine", "the", "role", "of", "the", "CD3", "genes", "in", "thymocyte", "development", "and", "in", "T", "cell", "function", "we", "study", "mice", "in", "which", "the", "CD3", "genes", "have", "been", "eliminated", "by", "homologous", "recombination", "techniques", ".", "In", "addition", ",", "the", "mechanisms", "that", "govern", "expresion", "of", "the", "three", "CD3", "genes", "in", "early", "T", "cells", "are", "being", "studied", ".", "The", "gene", "which", "is", "aberrant", "in", "X", "-", "linked", "lymphoproliferative", "syndrome", "(", "XLP", ")", "(", "SAP", "/", "SH2D1A", ")", "has", "been", "cloned", "and", "its", "protein", "crystal", "structure", "solved", ".", "At", "least", "two", "sets", "of", "target", "molecules", "for", "this", "small", "SH2", "domain", "-", "containing", "protein", "have", "been", "identified", ":", "one", "family", "of", "hematopoietic", "cell", "surface", "receptors", ",", "i", ".", "e", ".", "the", "SLAM", "family", ",", "and", "a", "second", "molecule", ",", "which", "is", "a", "phosphorylated", "adapter", ".", "A", "SAP", "-", "like", "molecule", ",", "EAT", "-", "2", ",", "has", "also", "been", "found", "to", "interact", "with", "this", "family", "of", "surface", "receptors", ".", "Several", "lines", "of", "evidence", ",", "including", "analyses", "of", "missense", "mutations", "in", "XLP", "patients", ",", "support", "the", "notion", "that", "SAP", "/", "SH2D1A", "is", "a", "natural", "blocker", "of", "SH2", "-", "domain", "dependent", "interactions", "with", "members", "of", "the", "SLAM", "family", ".", "However", ",", "details", "of", "its", "role", "in", "signaling", "mechanisms", "are", "yet", "to", "be", "unravelled", ".", "Virus", "infections", "of", "a", "mouse", "in", "which", "the", "SAP", "/", "SH2D1A", "gene", "has", "been", "disrupted", "suggest", "that", "EBV", "infection", "is", "not", "per", "se", "critical", "for", "the", "development", "of", "XLP", "phenotypes", ".", "It", "appears", "that", "the", "SAP", "/", "SH2D1A", "gene", "plays", "a", "more", "fundamental", "role", "in", "T", "cell", "and", "APC", "interactions", "by", "controlling", "the", "signaling", "of", "SLAM", "family", "surface", "receptors", "and", "through", "a", "set", "of", "adapter", "molecules", ".", "Animal", "models", "of", "Inflammatory", "Bowel", "Disease", ".", "Three", "models", "for", "experimental", "enterocolitis", "are", "used", "in", "the", "lab", ",", "two", "are", "based", "on", "cell", "transfer", "technology", "and", "a", "third", "uses", "the", "IL", "-", "2null", "mouse", "crossed", "with", "the", "b2m", "null", "mouse", ".", "These", "systems", "permit", "a", "rapid", "analysis", "of", "the", "role", "of", "mutant", "T", "cells", "and", "the", "effect", "of", "specific", "inhibitors", "of", "T", "cell", "functions", "in", "vivo", ".", "Thus", ",", "we", "are", "able", "to", "dissect", "the", "pathways", "that", "lead", "to", "induction", "of", "colitis", ",", "which", "will", "set", "the", "stage", "for", "development", "of", "novel", "therapeutic", "agents", "."], "record": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_0> research interests <extra_id_5> the role of the CD3 genes in thymocyte development and in T cell function <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> research interests <extra_id_5> the mechanisms that govern expresion of the three CD3 genes in early T cells are being studied . <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1>", "entity": [{"type": "research interests", "offset": [14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27], "text": "the role of the CD3 genes in thymocyte development and in T cell function"}, {"type": "research interests", "offset": [47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64], "text": "the mechanisms that govern expresion of the three CD3 genes in early T cells are being studied ."}], "relation": [], "event": [], "spot": ["research interests"], "asoc": [], "spot_asoc": [{"span": "the role of the CD3 genes in thymocyte development and in T cell function", "label": "research interests", "asoc": []}, {"span": "the mechanisms that govern expresion of the three CD3 genes in early T cells are being studied .", "label": "research interests", "asoc": []}]}

D . , University of Illinois College of Medicine at Chicago , 1957 Dr . Jerome Hershman ' s focus in the laboratory is on improving treatment for thyroid cancer . Thyroid cancer is treated with radioactive iodine , but some cancers do not take it up because the tumor tissue has lost this function . Hershman and his colleagues are developing a method to restore the iodide uptake function of thyroid cancer cells . In collaboration with pathologists , they also are working on methods to improve the diagnosis of thyroid cancer on needle biopsies of thyroid nodules . Specifically , the objectives of Hershman ' s current research are to investigate the regulation of the human sodium / iodide symporter gene in human thyroid cancer cells and to manipulate its expression for cancer therapy . He and his colleagues have identified a putative transcription factor , factor S , that binds to a far - upstream enhancer element and thus increases NIS expression in normal thyroid cells . They found that this factor was missing in thyroid cancer cells . The identity of factor S is not clear . In Hershman ' s current research , he plans to characterize factor S protein and its expression in thyroid cancers , study its interaction with other transcription factors and regulatory elements and clone the full length DNA encoding human factor S . Hershman and his associates also have shown that papillary thyroid cancer cells express high levels of the enzyme nincotinamide N - methyl transferase ( NNMT ) . They are determining the regulation and function of NNMT in thyroid cancer cells . They are also studying NNMT as a biomarker for thyroid cancer , together with other unique proteins as biomarkers for thyroid cancer in needle biopsies of thyroid nodules .

{"text": "Prigogine was born in Moscow a few months before the Russian Revolution of 1917 , into a Jewish family . His father , Roman ( Ruvim Abramovich ) Prigogine , was a chemical engineer at the Imperial Moscow Technical School ; his mother , Yulia Vikhman , was a pianist . Because the family was critical of the new Soviet system , they left Russia in 1921 . They first went to Germany and in 1929 , to Belgium , where Prigogine received Belgian nationality in 1949 . His brother Alexandre ( 1913 - 1991 ) became an ornithologist . Prigogine studied chemistry at the Universit Libre de Bruxelles , where in 1950 , he became professor . In 1959 , he was appointed director of the International Solvay Institute in Brussels , Belgium . In that year , he also started teaching at the University of Texas at Austin in the United States , where he later was appointed Regental Professor and Ashbel Smith Professor of Physics and Chemical Engineering . From 1961 until 1966 he was affiliated with the Enrico Fermi Institute at the University of Chicago . In Austin , in 1967 , he co - founded the Center for Thermodynamics and Statistical Mechanics , now The Center for Complex Quantum Systems . In that year , he also returned to Belgium , where he became director of the Center for Statistical Mechanics and Thermodynamics . He was a member of numerous scientific organizations , and received numerous awards , prizes and 53 honorary degrees . In 1955 , Ilya Prigogine was awarded the Francqui Prize for Exact Sciences . For this study in irreversible thermodynamics , he received the Rumford Medal in 1976 , and in 1977 , the Nobel Prize in Chemistry . In 1989 , he was awarded the title of Viscount in the Belgian nobility by the King of the Belgians . Until his death , he was president of the International Academy of Science , Munich and was in 1997 , one of the founders of the International Commission on Distance Education ( CODE ) , a worldwide accreditation agency . In 1998 he was awarded an honoris causa doctorate by the UNAM in Mexico City .

{"text": "Dr . Jamshid Maddahi is internationally recognized as a leader and expert in cardiovascular disease research , teaching and patient care . Dr . Maddahi obtained his MD degree with Distinguished Honors in 1975 from Tehran University . He subsequently completed his residency and fellowship training in the United States in Internal Medicine , Cardiovascular Diseases , Nuclear Medicine , and Nuclear cardiology . Dr . Maddahi began his academic and research career in 1977 in the field of Nuclear Cardiology . His pioneering and collaborative research in this field has led to several seminal articles on clinical applications of Nuclear Cardiology . The scope of his research has included development and validation of methods for assessment of myocardial perfusion , detection and risk stratification of patients with suspected or known coronary artery disease , assessment of myocardial viability and cost effectiveness of nuclear imaging in the management of patients . At the present , Nuclear Cardiology has become a standard technique in cardiology . In the US alone , more than 10 million Nuclear Cardiology procedures are done each year . In 1990 , Dr . Maddahi became Director of Clinical PET Center at UCLA with the overall goal of extending applications of the new technique of PET scanning into the clinical arena in oncology , cardiology and neurology . Over the ensuing years , the pioneering work of the UCLA team led to ever increasing role of the PET scanning technique in management of patients with cancer and heart disease . In 1998 , Dr . Maddahi extended his research interest to the field of Cardiac CT . In 2007 , Dr . Maddahi lead the clinical investigations on the use of a new F - 18 labeled PET perfusion agent . This tracer , that is currently in Pahse II clinical trials , has the potential of becoming the dominant tracer for noninvasive assessment of coronary artery disease . Dr . Maddahi became Assistant Professor of Medicine at UCLA in 1981 and is currently Clinical Professor ( level 6 ) of Molecular and Medical Pharmacology ( Nuclear Medicine ) and Medicine ( Cardiology ) at David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA .

{"text": "Doleel was educated at Charles University in Prague and received his CSc ( roughly equivalent to a PhD ) in Slavic Philology from the Institute of the Czech Language of the Czechoslovak Academy of Sciences . Many of his teachers and mentors were representatives of the so - called Prague School , an internationally recognized and influential centre of inter - war structuralist and semiotic thought . The influence of the Prague School is evident in Dolezel ' s PhD thesis On the Style of Modern Czech Prose Fiction ( published in Czech in 1960 ) and inspires his later work . [ citation needed ] In the 1960s Dolezel worked concurrently as research fellow in the Institute of Czech Language and as assistant , and later associate , professor of the Philosophical Faculty of Charles University . He was engaged primarily in the application of mathematics ( especially statistics ) , information theory and cybernetics to the study of language and literature . He founded and co - edited a series entitled Prague Studies in Mathematical Linguistics . [ 1 ] In 1965 , Doleel was invited as visiting professor to the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor , where he stayed till 1968 . He co - edited ( with Richard W . Bailey ) a collection of studies Statistics and Style ( American Elsevier , 1969 ) . On his return to Prague he was appointed research fellow of the Institute of Czech Literature of the Czechoslovak Academy of Sciences , but in the fall of 1968 he left the country after the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia . He was invited to the University of Toronto as visiting professor in the Department of Slavic Languages and Literatures , where he later became full professor . He established the study of Czech language and literature at the university . In 1982 he was cross - appointed to the Centre for Comparative Literature . His main research interest was the theory of literature , with a focus on narrative ( narratology ) . Doleel ' s theoretical position was strongly influenced by analytic philosophy , especially by the conceptual framework of possible worlds . On his retirement in 1988 , the Centre organized an international conference \" Fictions and Worlds \" . [ 1 ] Doleel presented papers at many North American and European universities and international conferences . He was visiting professor at the University of Amsterdam , University of Munich and Charles University . He published numerous papers on the history of poetics , narratology and fictional semantics , and a couple of books on the same subjects .

{"text": "I studied Physics and Computer Science ( Informatics ) at the University of Hamburg , Germany before completing the Ph . D . program at CMU ' s CS department in 1989 . At the Applied Physics Department of the University of Hamburg , I worked on digital image processing systems in a research group focused on optical information processing , holography , and related areas . This led to work on multiprocessing systems for digital image processing , which was the basis for my Diplomarbeit in Informatics . For my Physics Diplom ( roughly equivalent to a MS degree ) I applied digital image processing methods to electron microscopic pictures of gold crystal formation on alkali - halide crystal surfaces . As in Hamburg , my life as a graduate student at CMU ' s CS department was divided between my main research interest on multiprocessor systems , their interconnect structures , and work on a multitude of very diverse projects . This included the Deep Thought Chess project , indoor helicopters , VLSI and CAD tool development , computer arithmetic , statistical modeling of application program behavior , and many little fun projects . After a brief , but enlightening ( and profitable ) vacation on Wall Street as a \" rocket scientist \" I started a project at Sun Microsystems on a seamless interconnect system to link workstations so that they can be used and administered as a single , potentially distributed multiprocessor systems ( S3 . mp ) . While a lot of interesting technology was developed for this project ( like integrated , high speed serial interconnect systems , better communication protocols , clock synchronization and distribution techniques ) , S3 . mp ultimately never became a commercial product . I still think that the idea of building large MP systems out of cheap and cost - effective workstations and / or PC ' s is sound , but now I also appreciate the economic argument against this approach : why endanger the high - margin , profitable server market by allowing the easy aggregation of low - cost , low - marging and low - profit PC ' s .

{"text": "Joseph Paradiso joined the MIT Media Laboratory in 1994 , where he is now an Associate Professor of Media Arts and Sciences directing the Responsive Environments Group , which explores which explores how sensor networks augment and mediate human experience , interaction and perception . His current research interests include embedded sensing systems and sensor networks , wearable and body sensor networks , energy harvesting and power management for embedded sensors , ubiquitous and pervasive computing , localization systems , passive and RFID sensor architectures , human - computer interfaces , and interactive media . He is also serving as co - director of the Things That Think Consortium , a group of Media Lab researchers and industrial partners examining the extreme future of embedded computation and sensing . Paradiso received a B . S . in electrical engineering and physics summa cum laude from Tufts University in 1977 , and in 1981 completed a Ph . D . in physics from MIT with Prof . Ulrich Becker as a K . T . Compton Fellow in the Nobel Prize - winning group headed by Prof . Samuel C . C . Ting at the Laboratory for Nuclear Science . His dissertation research was based on an experiment measuring high - energy muon pair production at the European Center for Nuclear Research ( CERN ) in Geneva , Switzerland . From 1981 to 1984 he conducted post - doctoral research at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology ( ETH ) in Zurich , where he developed precision drift chambers and fast electronics for the inner tracker of the L3 experiment at CERN / LEP . From 1984 - 1994 he was a physicist at the Draper Laboratory in Cambridge , Massachusetts , where , as a member of the NASA Systems and Advanced Sensors and Signal Processing Directorates , his research encompassed control algorithms for orbital and re - entry spacecraft , sonar systems for advanced underwater applications , fractal - based image processing , and high - energy physics detectors . From 1992 - 1994 , he directed the development of precision alignment sensors for the GEM muon detector at the Superconducting Supercollider , and was a visiting scientist at ETH - Zurich in 1991 and 1992 to design fast pattern - recognition algorithms for triggering an electromagnetic crystal calorimeter at the CERN Large Hadron Collider ( LHC ) . In addition to his research and academic career , Paradiso has been designing electronic music synthesizers and composing electronic music since 1975 , and long been active in the avant - garde music scene as a producer of electronic music programs for non - commercial radio . He has designed and built one of the world ' s largest modular synthesizers , and has designed MIDI systems for internationally - known musicians such as Pat Metheney and Lyle Mays . Paradiso has published over 200 academic papers on topics that involve sensor networks , ubiquitous computing , energy harvesting , low power electronics , interactive media , computer music , high - energy physics , and spacecraft control . He often lectures and consults internationally in these areas . His installations have also been shown at many notable worldwide artistic venues , ranging from the Ars Electronica Center in Linz , Austria to the Museum of Modern Art in Manhatta", "tokens":

Upon graduation in 1969 , he joined Texas Instruments , Inc . , where he did pioneering work in infrared detectors , MOS dynamic memories , silicon - on - insulator , and scaled MOS transistors , he joined Motorola , Inc . , in 1982 to start - up a new MOS integrated circuit manufacturing facility . His success led to two rapid promotions ; director of the Advanced Products Research and Development Laboratory in 1984 and vice president of the Technical Staff in 1985 . In 1986 , Tasch was appointed professor and Cockrell Family Regents Chair in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Texas . At UT , he initiated a research and educational program to improve the understanding and modeling of ion implantation in silicon . It now ranks as one of the top two programs in the world . He and his students have developed new and comprehensive models that predict the behavior of ion - implanted species in silicon devices , which is of fundamental importance to producing advanced ultra large - scale integrates circuits . He also established an MOS device modeling and analysis research and education program , which has become known worldwide . Numerous process and device models have been successfully transferred to many semiconductor manufacturers . In addition to his research , Tasch contributed to the establishment of SEMATECH and helped create the initial technology roadmaps used by SEMATECH and its member companies . Many of his innovations have been adopted as standard techniques and technologies by the integrated circuits industry as well as academia . His contributions are recognized with numerous awards . These include election to the National Academy of Engineering , selection as an Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers ( IEEE ) Fellow and Texas Instrument Fellow , and recipient of the J .

{"text": "My research interests are within the general field of industrial fluid mechanics , with the emphasis on the experimental study of turbulent flows , particularly wind tunnel measurements . Much of the data obtained from my studies of subsonic and supersonic jets in a crossflow ( UK MoD / EPSRC funded ) have been utilised by other academics and industry ( including Qinetic ( formerly DERA ) and ARA Ltd , UK ) for turbulence model validation . I have developed new instrumentation for turbulent flow studies , such as ; miniature surface wire gauges for skin friction and near - wall structure ( UK DTI funded ) , triangular pressure yawmeters for surface flow direction and skin friction , colour video analysis of liquid crystal surface coatings for measuring full - field shear stresses ( DTI / MoD funded ) and a twin - wire pulsed anemometer for measurements in recirculating flow regions ( SERC funded ) . My data on the flows in the slat and flap cove regions of an A - 300 Series high - lift wing section have been used by BAe Systems for model validation ( SERC funded ) . The results obtained from my ongoing research programme concerning the aerodynamics of regularly shaped cavities has recently been published in ESDU Data Items for use in design . I have also recently been involved in several major wind engineering studies . The first of these has involved the monitoring and assessment of wind - induced foundation loads on a full - scale electricity transmission tower ( fully funded by The National Grid Company , UK ) . The second is a study of the failure of transmission lines around the world due to high intensity winds such as tornadoes and microbursts ( a collaboration between UWO and the University of Surrey , funded by Manitoba Hydro and NSERC , Canada ) . The third was the recently completed EU project TRAPOS involving ten partners ( 1 . 5MEuro ) , concerning physical and numerical modelling of flow and dispersion of traffic pollution within urban street canyons . This project was part of the wider European project SATURN . Related to this topic I organised a Workshop at UWO called PHYSMOD 2005 concerned with physical modelling of flow and dispersion , which was held from 24 - 26 August 2005 .", "tokens": ["My", "research", "interests", "are", "within", "the", "general", "field", "of", "industrial", "fluid", "mechanics", ",", "with", "the", "emphasis", "on", "the", "experimental", "study", "of", "turbulent", "flows", ",", "particularly", "wind", "tunnel", "measurements", ".", "Much", "of", "the", "data", "obtained", "from", "my", "studies", "of", "subsonic", "and", "supersonic", "jets", "in", "a", "crossflow", "(", "UK", "MoD", "/", "EPSRC", "funded", ")", "have", "been", "utilised", "by", "other", "academics", "and", "industry", "(", "including", "Qinetic", "(", "formerly", "DERA", ")", "and", "ARA", "Ltd", ",", "UK", ")", "for", "turbulence", "model", "validation", ".", "I", "have", "developed", "new", "instrumentation", "for", "turbulent", "flow", "studies", ",", "such", "as", ";", "miniature", "surface", "wire", "gauges", "for", "skin", "friction", "and", "near", "-", "wall", "structure", "(", "UK", "DTI", "funded", ")", ",", "triangular", "pressure", "yawmeters", "for", "surface", "flow", "direction", "and", "skin", "friction", ",", "colour", "video", "analysis", "of", "liquid", "crystal", "surface", "coatings", "for", "measuring", "full", "-", "field", "shear", "stresses", "(", "DTI", "/", "MoD", "funded", ")", "and", "a", "twin", "-", "wire", "pulsed", "anemometer", "for", "measurements", "in", "recirculating", "flow", "regions", "(", "SERC", "funded", ")", ".", "My", "data", "on", "the", "flows", "in", "the", "slat", "and", "flap", "cove", "regions", "of", "an", "A", "-", "300", "Series", "high", "-", "lift", "wing", "section", "have", "been", "used", "by", "BAe", "Systems", "for", "model", "validation", "(", "SERC", "funded", ")", ".", "The", "results", "obtained", "from", "my", "ongoing", "research", "programme", "concerning", "the", "aerodynamics", "of", "regularly", "shaped", "cavities", "has", "recently", "been", "published", "in", "ESDU", "Data", "Items", "for", "use", "in", "design", ".", "I", "have", "also", "recently", "been", "involved", "in", "several", "major", "wind", "engineering", "studies", ".", "The", "first", "of", "these", "has", "involved", "the", "monitoring", "and", "assessment", "of", "wind", "-", "induced", "foundation", "loads", "on", "a", "full", "-", "scale", "electricity", "transmission", "tower", "(", "fully", "funded", "by", "The", "National", "Grid", "Company", ",", "UK", ")", ".", "The", "second", "is", "a", "study", "of", "the", "failure", "of", "transmission", "lines", "around", "the", "world", "due", "to", "high", "intensity", "winds", "such", "as", "tornadoes", "and", "microbursts", "(", "a", "collaboration", "between", "UWO", "and", "the", "University", "of", "Surrey", ",", "funded", "by", "Manitoba", "Hydro", "and", "NSERC", ",", "Canada", ")", ".", "The", "third", "was", "the", "recently", "completed", "EU", "project", "TRAPOS", "involving", "ten", "partners", "(", "1", ".", "5MEuro", ")", ",", "concerning", "physical", "and", "numerical", "modelling", "of", "flow", "and", "dispersion", "of", "traffic", "pollution", "within", "urban", "street", "canyons", ".", "This", "project", "was", "part", "of", "the", "wider", "European", "project", "SATURN", ".", "Related", "to", "this", "topic", "I", "organised", "a", "Workshop", "at", "UWO", "called", "PHYSMOD", "2005", "concerned", "with", "physical", "modelling", "of", "flow", "and", "dispersion", ",", "which", "was", "held", "from", "24", "-", "26", "August", "2005", "."], "record": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_0> research interests <extra_id_5> the general field of industrial fluid mechanics , with the emphasis on the experimental study of turbulent flows , particularly wind tunnel measurements <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1>", "entity": [{"type": "research interests", "offset": [5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27], "text": "the general field of industrial fluid mechanics , with the emphasis on the experimental study of turbulent flows , particularly wind tunnel measurements"}], "relation": [], "event": [], "spot": ["research interests"], "asoc": [], "spot_asoc": [{"span": "the general field of industrial fluid mechanics , with the emphasis on the experimental study of turbulent flows , particularly wind tunnel measurements", "label": "research interests", "asoc": []}]}
{"text": "Frank Drewnick is leading a research group in the Particle Chemistry Department at Max Planck Institute for Chemistry in Mainz . His research interests focus on various aspects of anthropogenic aerosol sources : source characteristics , transport and transformation of particles , and impact of emission sources on local air quality . For this purpose , a mobile aerosol research laboratory was developed in his group , which allows measurement of particle concentration and composition as well as of trace gases in real time . Before joining the MPI for Chemistry , Frank Drewnick worked at State University of New York in Albany , NY , USA from 2001 until 2002 where he performed early work on on - line aerosol mass spectrometry to investigate the urban aerosol in New York City . He received his PhD in 2000 at University of Hohenheim in Stuttgart on the development of an aerosol mass spectrometer . In our research group we develop , characterize and use modern aerosol measurement equipment to investigate the urban aerosol as well as emissions from anthropogenic sources . The major mission is to understand the composition , spatial distribution , and atmospheric aging of urban aerosols as well as the processes during their generation and transport , and to be able to get reliable information on their local impact . One focus of our work is on - line aerosol mass spectrometry . In the research group the Aerodyne Time - of - Flight Aerosol Mass Spectrometer ( ToF - AMS ) is used , typically in combination with other on - line instruments for physical characterization of particles . We participated in the development of the ToF - AMS together with other research groups , and mainly were involved in the characterization of this instrument to allow a reliable application in field and laboratory environments . In our research group , the mobile aerosol research laboratory MoLa was developed and constructed for flexible mobile and stationary analysis of the atmospheric aerosol . We use this platform regularly in the field and continuously improve it in parallel . MoLa provides a completely independent platform for efficient measurements of physical and chemical aerosol properties , of trace gases , and of various meteorological variables . We mainly use it for the investigation of urban aerosols and for probing of anthropogenic sources like sea - going ships , waste incineration plants , steelworks , wood combustion facilities , construction sites , and many others", "tokens": ["Frank", "Drewnick", "is", "leading", "a", "research", "group", "in", "the", "Particle", "Chemistry", "Department", "at", "Max", "Planck", "Institute", "for", "Chemistry", "in", "Mainz", ".", "His", "research", "interests", "focus", "on", "various", "aspects", "of", "anthropogenic", "aerosol", "sources", ":", "source", "characteristics", ",", "transport", "and", "transformation", "of", "particles", ",", "and", "impact", "of", "emission", "sources", "on", "local", "air", "quality", ".", "For", "this", "purpose", ",", "a", "mobile", "aerosol", "research", "laboratory", "was", "developed", "in", "his", "group", ",", "which", "allows", "measurement", "of", "particle", "concentration", "and", "composition", "as", "well", "as", "of", "trace", "gases", "in", "real", "time", ".", "Before", "joining", "the", "MPI", "for", "Chemistry", ",", "Frank", "Drewnick", "worked", "at", "State", "University", "of", "New", "York", "in", "Albany", ",", "NY", ",", "USA", "from", "2001", "until", "2002", "where", "he", "performed", "early", "work", "on", "on", "-", "line", "aerosol", "mass", "spectrometry", "to", "investigate", "the", "urban", "aerosol", "in", "New", "York", "City", ".", "He", "received", "his", "PhD", "in", "2000", "at", "University", "of", "Hohenheim", "in", "Stuttgart", "on", "the", "development", "of", "an", "aerosol", "mass", "spectrometer", ".", "In", "our", "research", "group", "we", "develop", ",", "characterize", "and", "use", "modern", "aerosol", "measurement", "equipment", "to", "investigate", "the", "urban", "aerosol", "as", "well", "as", "emissions", "from", "anthropogenic", "sources", ".", "The", "major", "mission", "is", "to", "understand", "the", "composition", ",", "spatial", "distribution", ",", "and", "atmospheric", "aging", "of", "urban", "aerosols", "as", "well", "as", "the", "processes", "during", "their", "generation", "and", "transport", ",", "and", "to", "be", "able", "to", "get", "reliable", "information", "on", "their", "local", "impact", ".", "One", "focus", "of", "our", "work", "is", "on", "-", "line", "aerosol", "mass", "spectrometry", ".", "In", "the", "research", "group", "the", "Aerodyne", "Time", "-", "of", "-", "Flight", "Aerosol", "Mass", "Spectrometer", "(", "ToF", "-", "AMS", ")", "is", "used", ",", "typically", "in", "combination", "with", "other", "on", "-", "line", "instruments", "for", "physical", "characterization", "of", "particles", ".", "We", "participated", "in", "the", "development", "of", "the", "ToF", "-", "AMS", "together", "with", "other", "research", "groups", ",", "and", "mainly", "were", "involved", "in", "the", "characterization", "of", "this", "instrument", "to", "allow", "a", "reliable", "application", "in", "field", "and", "laboratory", "environments", ".", "In", "our", "research", "group", ",", "the", "mobile", "aerosol", "research", "laboratory", "MoLa", "was", "developed", "and", "constructed", "for", "flexible", "mobile", "and", "stationary", "analysis", "of", "the", "atmospheric", "aerosol", ".", "We", "use", "this", "platform", "regularly", "in", "the", "field", "and", "continuously", "improve", "it", "in", "parallel", ".", "MoLa", "provides", "a", "completely", "independent", "platform", "for", "efficient", "measurements", "of", "physical", "and", "chemical", "aerosol", "properties", ",", "of", "trace", "gases", ",", "and", "of", "various", "meteorological", "variables", ".", "We", "mainly", "use", "it", "for", "the", "investigation", "of", "urban", "aerosols", "and", "for", "probing", "of", "anthropogenic", "sources", "like", "sea", "-", "going", "ships", ",", "waste", "incineration", "plants", ",", "steelworks", ",", "wood", "combustion", "facilities", ",", "construction", "sites", ",", "and", "many", "others"], "record": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_0> title <extra_id_5> leading a research group <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> work for <extra_id_5> Max Planck Institute for Chemistry in Mainz <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> gender <extra_id_5> His <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> research interests <extra_id_5> various aspects of anthropogenic aerosol sources : source characteristics , transport and transformation of particles , and impact of emission sources on local air quality <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> work record <extra_id_5> Before joining the MPI for Chemistry , Frank Drewnick worked at State University of New York in Albany , NY , USA from 2001 until 2002 where he performed early work on on -

{"text": "I ' m the chief architect of the LLVM Compiler Infrastructure , an ambitious project to build a system of reusable compiler components that let you build all kinds of tools : compilers , debuggers , JIT systems , optimizers , static analysis systems , etc . In its current form , LLVM is most often used as an aggressive optimizer for C and C++ , which can produce X86 , X86 - 64 , PowerPC , ARM , Thumb , IA64 , Alpha , SPARC , MIPS , or C code . LLVM currently supports two primary front - ends : a GCC based front - end that supports C , C++ , Objective C , Objective C++ , Ada , and FORTRAN ; and \" Clang \" , a native LLVM front - end , that supports C and Objective C . In addition , LLVM is being extended and enhanced in a tremendous number of directions to support new optimizations , new targets , new domains , and to get new features . We hope to make it the future of open source compiler development . I currently manage the LLVM , GCC , Clang and other toolchain components at Apple Inc and drive the development of the Clang frontend . Before I started work on compilers , I was an operating system developer . I worked on the Dynix / PTX kernel debugger , helped add POSIX threads to Dynix / PTX , ported the Linux kernel to run in user space of Dynix / PTX ( providing compatibility with Linux user - space applications ) , was one of the primary conspirators on the Linux Kernel Corba ORB ( kORBit ) project , and am the author of the Operating Systems Resource Center ( a large collection of technical documentation that is useful when writing an OS or driver ) . I have a broad range of technical interests , particularly in systems - level issues at the hardware / software boundary ( compilers , debuggers , operating systems ) . I ' m also quite interested in graphics programming , getting my start back in the demo scene , writing DOS code in Turbo Pascal with inline assembly . At that point I wrote a series of articles on graphics programming and assembly - level optimizations . More recently I wrote a graphical robotics simulator , a pretty nice programmable raytracer raytracer , and a photon mapping implementation .

{"text": "Professor Gilles Fontaines research in astroseismology and stellar evolution recently led him to look at the fascinating challenges involved in characterizing exoplanets , one of the most important issues in contemporary astrophysics . Most of the time , an exoplanets properties cannot be determined unless the fundamental characteristics of its host star are known . The astroseismological method is an excellent tool for this purpose and , if properly used , can determine the structural parameters of a variable star with great precision , along with its internal stratification and its age . Gilles Fontaine has begun to explore this research approach , which has already proven its merits on several occasions when planets have been discovered orbiting variable stars . An impressive and growing number of white dwarfs seem to bear signs of planetary debris , opening the possibility of determining the bulk composition of these debris , a unique tool in planetology . The potential in this case is huge and very promising . White dwarfs play the role of a substrate , in a way , on which heavy elements constituting planetary debris are deposited , but a permeable substrate that allows the elements to pass through at different rates . The first step is to determine the current abundance of these heavy elements in a given white dwarf . This calls for sophisticated atmospheric models , a specialty of Gilles Fontaine young colleague Patrick Dufour . Second , these levels of abundance ( which vary over time ) have to be interpreted with the possible accretion rates , the effects of differential diffusion among the different elements , the presence of convection zones , thermohaline convection and other mechanisms that can partially mix external layers and ultimately extend back to the primordial composition . This is a considerable challenge , but Professor Fontaine has already begun addressing it with a major review of calculations of diffusion coefficients that he did in 1986 in co - operation with Georges Michaud at the Universit de Montral . He is counting on the collaboration of expert numerical analyst Pierre Brassard . He hopes to be soon able to effectively simulate accretion - diffusion episodes of planetary debris on white dwarfs .", "tokens": ["Professor", "Gilles", "Fontaines", "research", "in", "astroseismology", "and", "stellar", "evolution", "recently", "led", "him", "to", "look", "at", "the", "fascinating", "challenges", "involved", "in", "characterizing", "exoplanets", ",", "one", "of", "the", "most", "important", "issues", "in", "contemporary", "astrophysics", ".", "Most", "of", "the", "time", ",", "an", "exoplanets", "properties", "cannot", "be", "determined", "unless", "the", "fundamental", "characteristics", "of", "its", "host", "star", "are", "known", ".", "The", "astroseismological", "method", "is", "an", "excellent", "tool", "for", "this", "purpose", "and", ",", "if", "properly", "used", ",", "can", "determine", "the", "structural", "parameters", "of", "a", "variable", "star", "with", "great", "precision", ",", "along", "with", "its", "internal", "stratification", "and", "its", "age", ".", "Gilles", "Fontaine", "has", "begun", "to", "explore", "this", "research", "approach", ",", "which", "has", "already", "proven", "its", "merits", "on", "several", "occasions", "when", "planets", "have", "been", "discovered", "orbiting", "variable", "stars", ".", "An", "impressive", "and", "growing", "number", "of", "white", "dwarfs", "seem", "to", "bear", "signs", "of", "planetary", "debris", ",", "opening", "the", "possibility", "of", "determining", "the", "bulk", "composition", "of", "these", "debris", ",", "a", "unique", "tool", "in", "planetology", ".", "The", "potential", "in", "this", "case", "is", "huge", "and", "very", "promising", ".", "White", "dwarfs", "play", "the", "role", "of", "a", "substrate", ",", "in", "a", "way", ",", "on", "which", "heavy", "elements", "constituting", "planetary", "debris", "are", "deposited", ",", "but", "a", "permeable", "substrate", "that", "allows", "the", "elements", "to", "pass", "through", "at", "different", "rates", ".", "The", "first", "step", "is", "to", "determine", "the", "current", "abundance", "of", "these", "heavy", "elements", "in", "a", "given", "white", "dwarf", ".", "This", "calls", "for", "sophisticated", "atmospheric", "models", ",", "a", "specialty", "of", "Gilles", "Fontaine", "young", "colleague", "Patrick", "Dufour", ".", "Second", ",", "these", "levels", "of", "abundance", "(", "which", "vary", "over", "time", ")", "have", "to", "be", "interpreted", "with", "the", "possible", "accretion", "rates", ",", "the", "effects", "of", "differential", "diffusion", "among", "the", "different", "elements", ",", "the", "presence", "of", "convection", "zones", ",", "thermohaline", "convection", "and", "other", "mechanisms", "that", "can", "partially", "mix", "external", "layers", "and", "ultimately", "extend", "back", "to", "the", "primordial", "composition", ".", "This", "is", "a", "considerable", "challenge", ",", "but", "Professor", "Fontaine", "has", "already", "begun", "addressing", "it", "with", "a", "major", "review", "of", "calculations", "of", "diffusion", "coefficients", "that", "he", "did", "in", "1986", "in", "co", "-", "operation", "with", "Georges", "Michaud", "at", "the", "Universit", "de", "Montral", ".", "He", "is", "counting", "on", "the", "collaboration", "of", "expert", "numerical", "analyst", "Pierre", "Brassard", ".", "He", "hopes", "to", "be", "soon", "able", "to", "effectively", "simulate", "accretion", "-", "diffusion", "episodes", "of", "planetary", "debris", "on", "white", "dwarfs", "."], "record": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_0> research interests <extra_id_5> astroseismology and stellar evolution <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> gender <extra_id_5> him <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1>", "entity": [{"type": "gender", "offset": [11], "text": "him"}, {"type": "research interests", "offset": [5, 6, 7, 8], "text": "astroseismology and stellar evolution"}], "relation": [], "event": [], "spot": ["gender", "research interests"], "asoc": [], "spot_asoc": [{"span": "astroseismology and stellar evolution", "label": "research interests", "asoc": []}, {"span": "him", "label": "gender", "asoc": []}]}

{"text": "Fay grew up in Brooklyn , New York , but spent his summers in Southold , New York , close to the waters of the Long Island Sound . This motivated his lifelong interest in sailing and led him to earn a BS at the Webb Institute of Naval Architecture in 1944 , while an ensign with the U . S . Naval Reserve . Subsequently , he obtained an MS from MIT in marine engineering and a PhD from Cornell University in the unsteady propagation of gaseous detonation waves . After serving on the Cornell faculty from 1951 to 1955 , he was recruited to join MIT as an associate professor in the Department of Mechanical Engineering ( MechE ) , where he remained until transitioning to emeritus professor status in 1989 . The hallmark of Fays success as an innovator and contributor was listening carefully and crystallizing the essence of a discussion . Having reached that point , he was committed to seeing a process through to the appropriate conclusion . This was true across the board , whether it was a decision to perform a ready about in a sailing race or writing a definitive opinion on the ecological folly of extending the John F . Kennedy Airport runways into Jamaica Bay . His selection of research topics at MIT was geared to the common good : air and water pollution problems , acid rain , the safety hazards of liquefied gases , renewable energy , and the spread of oil and other hazardous liquids on the ocean . However , it was his early career work on combustion and detonation , hypersonic heat transfer , magnetohydrodynamics , and plasmadynamics that were the hallmarks of his election into the National Academy of Engineering in 1998 . He continued to create new textbooks after his decision to become emeritus . Fays great ability to synthesize solutions in difficult circumstances was amply demonstrated in his service to the Commonwealth of Massachusetts as chairman from 1972 to 1977 of the Massachusetts Port Authority ( Massport ) , the organization that controls Logan Airport , the Boston seaport , and several other Boston - area transportation facilities . Under Fays leadership , Massport transitioned into a sleeker , more environmentally - aware public - serving entity . In the words of Alan Altschuler , former secretary of transportation for the Commonwealth , Jays combination of wisdom , deep knowledge , total integrity , and courage in the face of ( unfair public ) attacks through even the most stressful controversies was absolutely remarkable . Fay played key roles in no fewer than 20 environmental organizations and panels that sought to develop public policy in a new world threatened with pollution and environmental hazards . This included 46 years of service as a director of the Union of Concerned Scientists seeking to ameliorate the threat of nuclear catastrophe . His reasoned and thoughtful scientific approach to these problems was critically important in building credibility for public examination of our approach to environmental threats . The family has arranged a funeral mass at St . Julia Church at 374 Boston Post Road in Weston , Massachusetts , on Saturday , June 13 , at 10 a . m . This will be followed by a celebration of his life at the Biagio Ristorante at 123 Moody Street in Waltham .", "tokens": ["Fay", "grew", "up", "in", "Brooklyn", ",", "New", "York", ",", "but",

{"text": "Koerner was born in Mlewiec near Toru , Poland ( formerly called Hofleben near Thorn , Prussia ) , on the family manor . He is the second son of the economist Johann Jakob Friedrich Koerner ( LL . D . , University of Heidelberg , 1922 ) and his wife Annelise , ne Koerner ( from a distant Berlin branch of the family ) . He has two well - known great grandfathers ; one was the Lord Mayor of Thorn 18421871 , Theodor Eduard Koerner ( 18101891 ; LLD , University of Berlin , 1835 ) , the other the Berlin orientalist painter Ernst Carl Eugen Koerner ( 18461927 ) . Koerner was educated at the Gymnasium of Krefeld , graduating in March 1960 . He performed obligatory military service the following two years , beginning his studies in German and English philology , the history of art , pedagogy , and philosophy at the University of Gttingen in the summer of 1962 , with the idea of becoming a high - school teacher . Three semesters later he moved to the Free University of Berlin , but also studied English literature and applied linguistics for two terms at the University of Edinburgh ( 19641965 ) , before returning to Berlin in the summer of 1965 for his Philosophicum . Koerner accepted an appointment as Professeur dallemand et danglais at the Collge Notre - Dame in Valenciennes , France , for the school year 19651966 . He returned to Germany and spent the next four semesters at the University of Gieen , completing the exams for both the State Diploma and the M . A . in April and May 1968 . By 1967 , he had changed the focus of his studies to the analysis of language , writing his M . A . thesis on the development and use of the subjunctive in German . Although he had made use of some Saussurean notions in his Masters thesis , it was not until the spring of 1969 , during his second semester as a graduate student in general linguistics at Simon Fraser University in Vancouver , B . C . , Canada that he began to familiarize himself with the essentials of the posthumously assembled Cours de linguistique gnrale of Ferdinand de Saussure . He developed the grand scheme of a thesis proposal on the history and evolution of Saussures linguistic theory , persuading G . L . Bursill - Hall to act as supervisor . Koerner started , in typical German fashion , with the compilation of a bibliography \" on the background , development and actual relevance of Ferdinand de Saussures general theory of language . \" It was accepted for publication a year later , by which time he was busily writing up the dissertation , which was defended in 1971 , with Dell Hymes as external examiner .

{"text": "British history since c . 1800 , especially cultural , intellectual and social history ; the history of the humanities and social sciences in Britain and America ; concepts and methods in cultural history ; educational history and policy . My own current research preoccupations lie principally in two areas : 1 ) The history of the humanities and social sciences . My 2013 book , Return from the Natives : How Margaret Mead Won the Second World War and Lost the Cold War , tells the story of the ' national character ' studies through which Mead and her closest associates such as Ruth Benedict and Geoffrey Gorer sought to apply anthropological and psychological methods to international relations at a time of rapid globalization . I am now pursuing further research in this area , with a special interest in the diffusion of the language of social science into everyday life through the media of non - fiction bestsellers , journalism and higher education , and in the comparative histories of the humanities in the anglophone world particularly since the 1960s : see below for recent publications in History of the Human Sciences and Past & Present . 2 ) Education in Postwar Britain . My work for the Royal Historical Society involved me in a wide range of contemporary debates about the place of history in modern British society , and this led me into historical research on the changing map of educational policy and provision in Britain over the last century . The fruits of this research have appeared in a series of Royal Historical Society lectures , ' Educating the Nation ' , in 2013 - 16 , and in a book , entitled ' The Crisis of the Meritocracy : Britain ' s Transition to Mass Education since the Second World War ' , which will be published by Oxford University Press in September 2020 . In turn this work led to a collaboration with Laura Carter and Chris Jeppesen with whom I will be engaged in 2017 - 21 in a four - year project funded by the ESRC on ' Secondary Education and Social Change in the UK since 1945 ' ( for more information , see our website at https : / / sesc . hist . cam . ac . uk / ) . I have also had a longstanding interest in the history of collecting . With colleagues at Caius College I have developed the undergraduate Themes & Sources option on the history of collecting ( which I currently teach with Dr Melissa Calaresu ) and over the years I have supervised a number of PhD students in this area ( including two with AHRC collaborative doctoral awards ) who now work in a variety of jobs from academic posts to museum curatorships to positions in the heritage industry .", "tokens": ["British", "history", "since", "c", ".", "1800", ",", "especially", "cultural", ",", "intellectual", "and", "social", "history", ";", "the", "history", "of",

{"text": "My interests and career focus is hardware development and its implementation in support of biomedical applications . After obtaining my Ph . D . , I worked for nine years at Intermagnetics General Corporation ( acquired by Philips in 2006 ) as scientist developing radio frequency ( RF ) hardware and applications for MRI animal systems . In 1990 I joined the University of Minnesota as an Assistant Professor of Radiology to advance MRI applications . During my tenure at the U of MN I formed the Center for Interdisciplinary Applications in Magnetic Resonance ( CIA - MR ) that housed a 1 . 5 T / 680mm MRI system , a 5 . 0 T / 400mm MRI system and a 17 T / 50 mm vertical bore levitation magnet . These systems were instrumental in laying the foundation for developing the concept of a hybrid MR - PET scanner , integrating a 6 MeV LINAC into a 1 . 5 MRI scanner and developing magnetic levitation as a ground - based research tool to simulate microgravity . The CIAMR supported MR activities for several investigators that studied 31P NMR of hemorrhagic shock , MR imaging and spectroscopy of pancreas and islet viability , bioreactor development and function and cryopreservation . On August 1 , 2007 , collapse of the I35W bridge in Minneapolis forced the CIAMR to cease operations because it was within 50 feet of the bridge . The lab was relocated in August 2008 to a 5 , 800 sq . ft facility in Minnetonka , MN , about 18 miles from campus . Dr . Hammers present research focuses on the effect of gravity on metabolomic , proteomic and genomic expression of osteoblasts and the effect of gravity on induced pluripotent stem cell ( iPSC ) differentiation . His laboratory is comparing the outcome of ground - based magnetic levitation studies to those flown aboard the ISS in low earth orbit . One of the goals is to determine if magnetic levitation is a viable ground - based analog of microgravity . The research has implications for better understanding the mechanisms behind osteoporosis and the differentiation of pluripotent stem cells . Dr . Hammer is also pursuing the development of a miniature lyophilzer for deployment on the NASA Europa fly - by mission scheduled for a 2022 launch . This project includes evaluation of NMR spectroscopy as a tool to detect molecular markers of extant life .", "tokens": ["My", "interests", "and", "career", "focus", "is", "hardware", "development", "and", "its", "implementation", "in", "support", "of", "biomedical", "applications", ".", "After", "obtaining", "my", "Ph", ".", "D", ".", ",", "I", "worked", "for", "nine", "years", "at", "Intermagnetics", "General", "Corporation", "(", "acquired", "by", "Philips", "in", "2006", ")", "as", "scientist", "developing", "radio", "frequency", "(", "RF", ")", "hardware", "and", "applications", "for", "MRI", "animal", "systems", ".", "In", "1990", "I", "joined", "the", "University", "of", "Minnesota", "as", "an", "Assistant", "Professor", "of", "Radiology", "to", "advance", "MRI", "applications", ".", "During", "my", "tenure", "at", "the", "U", "of", "MN", "I", "formed", "the", "Center", "for", "Interdisciplinary", "Applications", "in", "Magnetic", "Resonance", "(", "CIA", "-", "MR", ")", "that", "housed", "a", "1", ".", "5", "T", "/", "680mm", "MRI", "system", ",", "a", "5", ".", "0", "T", "/", "400mm", "MRI", "system", "and", "a", "17", "T", "/", "50", "mm", "vertical", "bore", "levitation", "magnet", ".", "These", "systems", "were", "instrumental", "in", "laying", "the", "foundation", "for", "developing", "the", "concept", "of", "a", "hybrid", "MR", "-", "PET", "scanner", ",", "integrating", "a", "6", "MeV", "LINAC", "into", "a", "1", ".", "5", "MRI", "scanner", "and", "developing", "magnetic", "levitation", "as", "a", "ground", "-", "based", "research", "tool", "to", "simulate", "microgravity", ".", "The", "CIAMR", "supported", "MR", "activities", "for", "several", "investigators", "that", "studied", "31P", "NMR", "of", "hemorrhagic", "shock", ",", "MR", "imaging", "and", "spectroscopy", "of", "pancreas", "and", "islet", "viability", ",", "bioreactor", "development", "and", "function", "and", "cryopreservation", ".", "On", "August", "1", ",", "2007", ",", "collapse", "of", "the", "I35W", "bridge", "in", "Minneapolis", "forced", "the", "CIAMR", "to", "cease", "operations", "because", "it", "was", "within", "50", "feet", "of", "the", "bridge", ".", "The", "lab", "was", "relocated", "in", "August", "2008", "to", "a", "5", ",", "800", "sq", ".", "ft", "facility", "in", "Minnetonka", ",", "MN", ",", "about", "18", "miles", "from", "campus", ".", "Dr", ".", "Hammers", "present", "research", "focuses", "on", "the", "effect", "of", "gravity", "on", "metabolomic", ",", "proteomic", "and", "genomic", "expression", "of", "osteoblasts", "and", "the", "effect", "of", "gravity", "on", "induced", "pluripotent", "stem", "cell", "(", "iPSC", ")", "differentiation", ".", "His", "laboratory", "is", "comparing", "the", "outcome", "of", "ground", "-", "based", "magnetic", "levitation", "studies", "to", "those", "flown", "aboard", "the", "ISS", "in", "low", "earth", "orbit", ".", "One", "of", "the", "goals", "is", "to", "determine", "if", "magnetic", "levitation", "is", "a", "viable", "ground", "-", "based", "analog", "of", "microgravity", ".", "The", "research", "has", "implications", "for", "better", "understanding", "the", "mechanisms", "behind", "osteoporosis", "and", "the", "differentiation", "of", "pluripotent", "stem", "cells", ".", "Dr", ".", "Hammer", "is", "also", "pursuing", "the", "development", "of", "a", "miniature", "lyophilzer", "for", "deployment", "on", "the", "NASA", "Europa", "fly", "-", "by", "mission", "scheduled", "for", "a", "2022", "launch", ".", "This", "project", "includes", "evaluation", "of", "NMR", "spectroscopy", "as", "a", "tool", "to", "detect", "molecular", "markers", "of", "extant", "life", "."], "record": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_0> research interests <extra_id_5> hardware development and its implementation in support of biomedical applications <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> work record <extra_id_5> After obtaining my Ph .

He went on to study Aeronautical and Astronautical Engineering from Massachusetts Institute of Technology . Growing up , Rikin aspired to join the U . S . Air Force , but lacking perfect eyesight , was told to undergo a very painful eye surgery to be considered . Not one to let go of his passion he decided to go ahead with the eye surgery despite the pain . His aspirations to join the Air Force sparked a journey that led him to work at a private space tourism company , earn a private pilot license , and venture halfway across the globe to make his contribution to the social sector . Due to bureaucratic procedures , Rikin took a year hiatus from work after the surgery , and then joined the Air Force . This period provided him with a lot of time for introspection and he often found himself thinking about the earth and its sustainable development . During this time , he joined Oracle as a member of the technical staff on Oracles Secure Enterprise Search team from February 2005 to September 2006 . Oracle was just beginning its foray into developing a search product and he was given the role of a researcher . Rikin investigated the development of algorithms that could be used to search for proper nouns , like a persons name , based on the way it sounds . He co - invented two pending patents while he worked at Oracle . After working at Oracle as a software engineer and on the verge of joining the U . S . Air Force , he changed course to see how he could contribute toward eliminating poverty . Rikin reverse - migrated to India to help start a biodiesel venture on the wastelands of Maharashtra . During this journey he spent a lot of time in rural India and became conversant with the Indian agricultural system . As the biodiesel venture did not pan out the way he had hoped , he joined the Microsoft Research India team in Bangalore in the Technology for Emerging Markets program where his idea for Digital Green was formed .", "tokens": ["Rikin", "was", "born", "and", "raised", "in", "the", "U", ".", "S", ".", "and", "studied", "computer", "science", "and", "physics", "at", "Carnegie", "Mellon", "University", ".", "He", "went", "on", "to", "study", "Aeronautical", "and", "Astronautical", "Engineering", "from", "Massachusetts", "Institute", "of", "Technology", ".", "Growing", "up", ",", "Rikin", "aspired", "to", "join", "the", "U", ".", "S", ".", "Air", "Force", ",", "but", "lacking", "perfect", "eyesight", ",", "was", "told", "to", "undergo", "a", "very", "painful", "eye", "surgery", "to", "be", "considered", ".", "Not", "one", "to", "let", "go", "of", "his", "passion", "he", "decided", "to", "go", "ahead", "with", "the", "eye", "surgery", "despite", "the", "pain", ".", "His", "aspirations", "to", "join", "the", "Air", "Force", "sparked", "a", "journey", "that", "led", "him", "to", "work", "at", "a", "private", "space", "tourism", "company", ",", "earn", "a", "private", "pilot", "license", ",", "and", "venture", "halfway", "across", "the", "globe", "to", "make", "his", "contribution", "to", "the", "social", "sector", ".", "Due", "to", "bureaucratic", "procedures", ",", "Rikin", "took", "a", "year", "hiatus", "from", "work", "after", "the", "surgery", ",", "and", "then", "joined", "the", "Air", "Force", ".", "This", "period", "provided", "him", "with", "a", "lot", "of", "time", "for", "introspection", "and", "he", "often", "found", "himself", "thinking", "about", "the", "earth", "and", "its", "sustainable", "development", ".", "During", "this", "time", ",", "he", "joined", "Oracle", "as", "a", "member", "of", "the", "technical", "staff", "on", "Oracles", "Secure", "Enterprise", "Search", "team", "from", "February", "2005", "to", "September", "2006", ".", "Oracle", "was", "just", "beginning", "its", "foray", "into", "developing", "a", "search", "product", "and", "he", "was", "given", "the", "role", "of", "a", "researcher", ".", "Rikin", "investigated", "the", "development", "of", "algorithms", "that", "could", "be", "used", "to", "search", "for", "proper", "nouns", ",", "like", "a", "persons", "name", ",", "based", "on", "the", "way", "it", "sounds", ".", "He", "co", "-", "invented", "two", "pending", "patents", "while", "he", "worked", "at", "Oracle", ".", "After", "working", "at", "Oracle", "as", "a", "software", "engineer", "and", "on", "the", "verge", "of", "joining", "the", "U", ".", "S", ".", "Air", "Force", ",", "he", "changed", "course", "to", "see", "how", "he", "could", "contribute", "toward", "eliminating", "poverty", ".", "Rikin", "reverse", "-", "migrated", "to", "India", "to", "help", "start", "a", "biodiesel", "venture", "on", "the", "wastelands", "of", "Maharashtra", ".", "During", "this", "journey", "he", "spent", "a", "lot", "of", "time", "in", "rural", "India", "and", "became", "conversant", "with", "the", "Indian", "agricultural", "system", ".", "As", "the", "biodiesel", "venture", "did", "not", "pan", "out", "the", "way", "he", "had", "hoped", ",", "he", "joined", "the", "Microsoft", "Research", "India", "team", "in", "Bangalore", "in", "the", "Technology", "for", "Emerging", "Markets", "program", "where", "his", "idea", "for", "Digital", "Green", "was", "formed", "."], "record": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_0> education <extra_id_5> Rikin was born and raised in the U .

{"text": "Derek L . Hansen is an Assistant Professor at Brigham Young University ' s Information Technology program in the School of Technology ( http : / / it . et . byu . edu / ) . He was formerly at the University of Marylands iSchool where he Directed the Center for the Advanced Study of Communities and Information ( http : / / casci . umd . edu ) and was a member of the Human Computer Interaction Lab ( http : / / www . cs . umd . edu / hcil / ) . Dr . Hansen completed his PhD from the University of Michigans School of Information where he was an NSF - funded interdisciplinary STIET Fellow ( http : / / stiet . si . umich . edu / ) focused on understanding and designing effective online socio - technical systems . Prior to graduate school he worked as an analyst and independent consultant in the healthcare industry , where he recognized a great need for radical changes in the way information is managed and shared , as well as the social and economic challenges that impede such change . His research focuses on mass collaboration , information reuse , games for change , consumer health informatics , and social network analysis and visualization . One line of research is focused on helping community analysts make sense of the mass of social data available through social media sites . He is currently working with the Social Media Research Foundation and others in the HCIL to develop NodeXL , a network analysis and visualization tool that runs in Microsoft Excel , along with training materials for social media analysts . Another line of research applies those methods to understand best practices for supporting mass collaboration in medical , scientific , and entertainment domains . Finally , Dr . Hansen is involved with designing novel tools and activities that take advantage of the unique properties of information technologies . These include \" collection recommender systems , \" a novel \" veiled viral marketing \" technique that uses social networking applications ( i . e . , Facebook ) to anonymously disseminate information about stigmatized illnesses through friendship networks , games like \" Odd Leaf Out \" that encourage citizen scientists to help make sense of images of plant species , and methods to predict the political tendencies of Twitter account Followers .", "tokens": ["Derek", "L", ".", "Hansen", "is", "an", "Assistant", "Professor", "at", "Brigham", "Young", "University", "'", "s", "Information", "Technology", "program", "in", "the", "School", "of", "Technology", "(", "http", ":", "/", "/", "it", ".", "et", ".", "byu", ".", "edu", "/", ")", ".", "He", "was", "formerly", "at", "the", "University", "of", "Marylands", "iSchool", "where", "he", "Directed", "the", "Center", "for", "the", "Advanced", "Study", "of", "Communities", "and", "Information", "(", "http", ":", "/", "/", "casci", ".", "umd", ".", "edu", ")", "and", "was", "a", "member", "of", "the", "Human", "Computer", "Interaction", "Lab", "(", "http", ":", "/", "/", "www", ".", "cs", ".", "umd", ".", "edu", "/", "hcil", "/", ")", ".", "Dr", ".", "Hansen", "completed", "his", "PhD", "from", "the", "University", "of", "Michigans", "School", "of", "Information", "where", "he", "was", "an", "NSF", "-", "funded", "interdisciplinary", "STIET", "Fellow", "(", "http", ":", "/", "/", "stiet", ".", "si", ".", "umich", ".", "edu", "/", ")", "focused", "on", "understanding", "and", "designing", "effective", "online", "socio", "-", "technical", "systems", ".", "Prior", "to", "graduate", "school", "he", "worked", "as", "an", "analyst", "and", "independent", "consultant", "in", "the", "healthcare", "industry", ",", "where", "he", "recognized", "a", "great", "need", "for", "radical", "changes", "in", "the", "way", "information", "is", "managed", "and", "shared", ",", "as", "well", "as", "the", "social", "and", "economic", "challenges", "that", "impede", "such", "change", ".", "His", "research", "focuses", "on", "mass", "collaboration", ",", "information", "reuse", ",", "games", "for", "change", ",", "consumer", "health", "informatics", ",", "and", "social", "network", "analysis", "and", "visualization", ".", "One", "line", "of", "research", "is", "focused", "on", "helping", "community", "analysts", "make", "sense", "of", "the", "mass", "of", "social", "data", "available", "through", "social", "media", "sites", ".", "He", "is", "currently", "working", "with", "the", "Social", "Media", "Research", "Foundation", "and", "others", "in", "the", "HCIL", "to", "develop", "NodeXL", ",", "a", "network", "analysis", "and", "visualization", "tool", "that", "runs", "in", "Microsoft", "Excel", ",", "along", "with", "training", "materials", "for", "social", "media", "analysts", ".", "Another", "line", "of", "research", "applies", "those", "methods", "to", "understand", "best", "practices", "for", "supporting", "mass", "collaboration", "in", "medical", ",", "scientific", ",", "and", "entertainment", "domains", ".", "Finally", ",", "Dr", ".", "Hansen", "is", "involved", "with", "designing", "novel", "tools", "and", "activities", "that", "take", "advantage", "of", "the", "unique", "properties", "of", "information", "technologies", ".", "These", "include", "\"", "collection", "recommender", "systems", ",", "\"", "a", "novel", "\"", "veiled", "viral", "marketing", "\"", "technique", "that", "uses", "social", "networking", "applications", "(", "i", ".", "e", ".", ",", "Facebook", ")", "to", "anonymously", "disseminate", "information", "about", "stigmatized", "illnesses", "through", "friendship", "networks", ",", "games", "like", "\"", "Odd", "Leaf", "Out", "\"", "that", "encourage", "citizen", "scientists", "to", "help", "make", "sense", "of", "images", "of", "plant", "species", ",", "and", "methods", "to", "predict", "the", "political", "tendencies", "of", "Twitter", "account", "Followers", "."], "record": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_0> title <extra_id_5> Assistant Professor <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> work for <extra_id_5> Brigham Young University <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> gender <extra_id_5> He <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> work record <extra_id_5> He was formerly at the University of Marylands iSchool where he Directed the Center for the Advanced Study of Communities and Information ( http : / / casci . umd . edu ) and was a member of the Human Computer Interaction Lab ( http : / / www . cs . umd . edu / hcil / ) . <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> education <extra_id_5> Dr .

{"text": "Barlow is the son of the civil servant Sir Alan Barlow and his wife Lady Nora ( ne Darwin ) . He was educated at Winchester College , and earned an M . D . at Harvard University in 1946 . [ 1 ] In 1953 Barlow discovered that the frog brain has neurons which fire in response to specific visual stimuli . This was a precursor to the work of Hubel and Wiesel on visual receptive fields in the visual cortex . He has made a long study of visual inhibition , the process whereby a neuron firing in response to one group of retinal cells can inhibit the firing of another neuron ; this allows perception of relative contrast . In 1961 Barlow wrote a seminal article where he asked what the computational aims of the visual system are . He concluded that one of the main aims of visual processing is the reduction of redundancy . While the brightnesses of neighbouring points in images are usually very similar , the retina reduces this redundancy . His work thus was central to the field of statistics of natural scenes that relates the statistics of images of real world scenes to the properties of the nervous system . Barlow also worked in the field of factorial codes . The goal was to encode images with statistically redundant components or pixels such that the code components are statistically independent . Such codes are hard to find but highly useful for purposes such as image classification . Barlow is a fellow of Trinity College , University of Cambridge . He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1969 and was awarded their Royal Medal in 1993 . [ 2 ] He received the 1993 Australia Prize for his research into the mechanisms of visual perception and the 2009 Swartz Prize for Theoretical and Computational Neuroscience from the Society for Neuroscience . He was awarded the first Ken Nakayama Prize from the Vision Sciences Society in 2016 .

{"text": "He is on several Program Committees for various Agents , Services and Semantic Web conferences ; he chaired the 2003 and 2005 AAAI Symposia on Agents and Semantic Web Services ; was program co - chair for the Tenth Cooperative Information Agents Workshop in 2006 , and the Tenth International Conference on Electronic Commerce in 2008 . He co - authored the W3C OWL - S Service Description Language Recommendation Note ; and in 2004 - 06 , he jointly coordinated AgentLink III - an EU funded Coordination Action Project for Agent - Based Computing . He is on the editorial board for IEEE Intelligent Systems , where he also runs a department on Agents . He is also on the editorial board for JAAMAS - the Journal of Autonomous Agents and Multi - Agent Systems , and is co - editor in chief for the Electronic Commerce Research and Applications Journal . He has been on the scientific advisory board for Tideway Systems . Welcome Terry joined the University of Liverpool in 2008 , after having spent six years at the University of Southampton , where he carried out research in agent - based computing and knowledge - based systems and services . His specific interest is in the use of ontological knowledge for the support of service discovery and provision . He was previously involved with the Intelligent Software Agents Laboratory at Carnegie Mellon University . Prior to working at CMU , he spent five years as a Graduate Student at the Computing Science Department , University of Aberdeen , Scotland , after having spent three formative years in industry as a Software Engineer . Since becoming faculty , he has also spent time as a visiting scientist at several international universities ; including the Mindswap labs at UMD , the Vrije Universiteit , Amsterdam , and more recently , the Nokia Research Center , Cambridge , and CSAIL at MIT . It was on his return to the UK that Terry met , and a little later , subsequently married Valli Tamma ( University of Liverpool ) in Bari , Italy , and in the summer of 2007 , they gave birth to a little tyke called Alessandro . For a while , he spent much of his time in either Liverpool , or Southampton due to the two - body problem ( the challenge of having both members of an academic couple work in the same city ) . However , this was finally solved in August 2008 , when he joined the University of Liverpool , eliminating what had been an 800km round trip weekly commute .", "tokens": ["He", "is", "on", "several", "Program", "Committees", "for", "various", "Agents", ",", "Services", "and", "Semantic", "Web", "conferences", ";", "he", "chaired", "the", "2003", "and", "2005", "AAAI", "Symposia", "on", "Agents", "and", "Semantic", "Web", "Services", ";", "was", "program", "co", "-", "chair", "for", "the", "Tenth", "Cooperative", "Information", "Agents", "Workshop", "in", "2006", ",", "and", "the", "Tenth", "International", "Conference", "on", "Electronic", "Commerce", "in", "2008", ".", "He", "co", "-", "authored", "the", "W3C", "OWL", "-", "S", "Service", "Description", "Language", "Recommendation", "Note", ";", "and", "in", "2004", "-", "06", ",", "he", "jointly", "coordinated", "AgentLink", "III", "-", "an", "EU", "funded", "Coordination", "Action", "Project", "for", "Agent", "-", "Based", "Computing", ".", "He", "is", "on", "the", "editorial", "board", "for", "IEEE", "Intelligent", "Systems", ",", "where", "he", "also", "runs", "a", "department", "on", "Agents", ".", "He", "is", "also", "on", "the", "editorial", "board", "for", "JAAMAS", "-", "the", "Journal", "of", "Autonomous", "Agents", "and", "Multi", "-", "Agent", "Systems", ",", "and", "is", "co", "-", "editor", "in", "chief", "for", "the", "Electronic", "Commerce", "Research", "and", "Applications", "Journal", ".", "He", "has", "been", "on", "the", "scientific", "advisory", "board", "for", "Tideway", "Systems", ".", "Welcome", "Terry", "joined", "the", "University", "of", "Liverpool", "in", "2008", ",", "after", "having", "spent", "six", "years", "at", "the", "University", "of", "Southampton", ",", "where", "he", "carried", "out", "research", "in", "agent", "-", "based", "computing", "and", "knowledge", "-", "based", "systems", "and", "services", ".", "His", "specific", "interest", "is", "in", "the", "use", "of", "ontological", "knowledge", "for", "the", "support", "of", "service", "discovery", "and", "provision", ".", "He", "was", "previously", "involved", "with", "the", "Intelligent", "Software", "Agents", "Laboratory", "at", "Carnegie", "Mellon", "University", ".", "Prior", "to", "working", "at", "CMU", ",", "he", "spent", "five", "years", "as", "a", "Graduate", "Student", "at", "the", "Computing", "Science", "Department", ",", "University", "of", "Aberdeen", ",", "Scotland", ",", "after", "having", "spent", "three", "formative", "years", "in", "industry", "as", "a", "Software", "Engineer", ".", "Since", "becoming", "faculty", ",", "he", "has", "also", "spent", "time", "as", "a", "visiting", "scientist", "at", "several", "international", "universities", ";", "including", "the", "Mindswap", "labs", "at", "UMD", ",", "the", "Vrije", "Universiteit", ",", "Amsterdam", ",", "and", "more", "recently", ",", "the", "Nokia", "Research", "Center", ",", "Cambridge", ",", "and", "CSAIL", "at", "MIT", ".", "It", "was", "on", "his", "return", "to", "the", "UK", "that", "Terry", "met", ",", "and", "a", "little", "later", ",", "subsequently", "married", "Valli", "Tamma", "(", "University", "of", "Liverpool", ")", "in", "Bari", ",", "Italy", ",", "and", "in", "the", "summer", "of", "2007", ",", "they", "gave", "birth", "to", "a", "little", "tyke", "called", "Alessandro", ".", "For", "a", "while", ",", "he", "spent", "much", "of", "his", "time", "in", "either", "Liverpool", ",", "or", "Southampton", "due", "to", "the", "two", "-", "body", "problem", "(", "the", "challenge", "of", "having", "both", "members", "of", "an", "academic", "couple", "work", "in", "the", "same", "city", ")", ".", "However", ",", "this", "was", "finally", "solved", "in", "August", "2008", ",", "when", "he", "joined", "the", "University", "of", "Liverpool", ",", "eliminating", "what", "had", "been", "an", "800km", "round", "trip", "weekly", "commute", "."], "record": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_0> gender <extra_id_5> He <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> take office <extra_id_5> chaired the 2003 and 2005 AAAI Symposia on Agents and Semantic Web Services <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> take office <extra_id_5> program co -

{"text": "Degree in Medicine in 1973 from University of Padova . Full Professor of General Pathology at the Faculty of Medicine of the University of Padova , Tullio Pozzan served as Director of the Department of Experimental Biomedical Sciences from 1990 to 2002 , and is currently Director of the Biosciences Postgraduate School ; served as Chairman of the European Cell Biology Organization ( ECBO ) from 1999 to 2001 and of the Italian Cell Biology and Differentiation Society from 2000 to 2004 ; has acted as Coordinator of a MIUR ( Italian Ministry of Education and Research ) Centre of Excellence , and currently serves as Director of the Interdepartmental Centre which developed from the Centre of Excellence . Tullio Pozzan was awarded the Feltrinelli prize for medicine in 2000 and presently is member of the Telethon Scientific Committee . He has been member of EMBO since 1992 , of the European Academy since 1998 , of Accademia Galileiana since 1997 , and of the Accademia dei Lincei since 2001 . He was appointed to the USA National Academy of Sciences in 2006 . For the last 25 years his main scientific interest has been the control of Ca2+ and other second messenger homeostasis in living cells . In this field he has contributed a few important methodological improvements , from the intracellularly trappable fluorescent Ca2+ indicators to the recombinant targeted aequorins to the genetically encoded cAMP probes . The interest for the methodological aspects have been always dictated by the needs of finding original ways to better understand cell physiology and pathology . Among his major contributions to the understanding of second messenger signalling , the discovery of the early rise in cytosolic Ca2+ concentration in lymphocytes upon mitogenic stimulation , the key role of Ca2+ and protein kinase C in neutrophil activation , the capacity of mitochondria to rapidly take up Ca2+ in living cells , the existence and role of cAMP microdomains in cardiac cells . At present the experimental activity of the group coordinated by Tullio Pozzan is carried out primarily at the Department of Biomedical Sciences of the University of Padova , located a few hundred meters from the VIMM , in close collaboration with VIMM groups . At the VIMM his main role has been that of coordinating the activity of young collaborators with the aim of helping them reaching complete independence . Three of them ( F . Mammano , A . Viola and M . Zaccolo ) are now independent PIs and C . Lodovichi , the last young PI recruited at the VIMM , is closely collaborating with Dr .

{"text": "Dr . Tamminga holds the Lou and Ellen McGinley Distinguished Chair and the McKenzie Chair in Psychiatry at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical School and is the Chairman of the Department of Psychiatry and the Chief of the Translational Neuroscience Division in Schizophrenia at UTSW . She received her M . D . degree from Vanderbilt University and completed residency training in psychiatry at the University of Chicago . She served on the University of Chicago faculty from 1975 to 1979 and moved to the NINDS for training in Neurology in 1978 . After joining the faculty at the University of Maryland Medical School in 1979 , she practiced research , clinical care and teaching there until joining the faculty at UT Southwestern Medical School in 2003 . Dr . Tamminga is currently a member of NIMHs National Advisory Board and has served on the Board of Scientific Counselors of the National Institute of Mental Health and the National Institute of Drug Abuse , as Council member and President of the American College of Neuropsychopharmacology , as a Member and Chair of the Psychopharmacological Drugs Advisory Committee of the FDA , as well as consultant for the Orphan Products Development Review Group , FDA . She is a member of the Advisory Board of the Brain and Behavioral Research Foundation ( NARSAD ) . She is currently the Deputy Editor of the American Journal of Psychiatry and on the editorial board of several other journals in the field . Dr . Tamminga was elected to the Institute of Medicine of the National Academies of Sciences in 1998 and has served on several IOM committees in that capacity . The goal of Dr . Tammingas research is to examine and understand the mechanisms underlying schizophrenia , especially its most prominent symptoms , psychosis and memory dysfunction , in order to build rational treatments for the illness . She evaluates the function of the living human brain in individuals with and without schizophrenia , using brain imaging techniques . Then , building on this knowledge , she uses human postmortem brain tissue to translate the functional alterations from the living human patient into molecular observations of the illness . Her ultimate goal is to base novel pharmacologies for psychosis and memory dysfunction on these observations and to use the altered in vivo imaging and postmortem molecular changes as biomarkers and targets for identifying animal models of disease and novel active pharmaceuticals .", "tokens": ["Dr", ".", "Tamminga", "holds", "the", "Lou", "and", "Ellen", "McGinley", "Distinguished", "Chair", "and", "the", "McKenzie", "Chair", "in", "Psychiatry", "at", "the", "University", "of", "Texas", "Southwestern", "Medical", "School", "and", "is", "the", "Chairman", "of", "the", "Department", "of", "Psychiatry", "and", "the", "Chief", "of", "the", "Translational", "Neuroscience", "Division", "in", "Schizophrenia", "at", "UTSW", ".", "She", "received", "her", "M", ".", "D", ".", "degree", "from", "Vanderbilt", "University", "and", "completed", "residency", "training", "in", "psychiatry", "at", "the", "University", "of", "Chicago", ".", "She", "served", "on", "the", "University", "of", "Chicago", "faculty", "from", "1975", "to", "1979", "and", "moved", "to", "the", "NINDS", "for", "training", "in", "Neurology", "in", "1978", ".", "After", "joining", "the", "faculty", "at", "the", "University", "of", "Maryland", "Medical", "School", "in", "1979", ",", "she", "practiced", "research", ",", "clinical", "care", "and", "teaching", "there", "until", "joining", "the", "faculty", "at", "UT", "Southwestern", "Medical", "School", "in", "2003", ".", "Dr", ".", "Tamminga", "is", "currently", "a", "member", "of", "NIMHs", "National", "Advisory", "Board", "and", "has", "served", "on", "the", "Board", "of", "Scientific", "Counselors", "of", "the", "National", "Institute", "of", "Mental", "Health", "and", "the", "National", "Institute", "of", "Drug", "Abuse", ",", "as", "Council", "member", "and", "President", "of", "the", "American", "College", "of", "Neuropsychopharmacology", ",", "as", "a", "Member", "and", "Chair", "of", "the", "Psychopharmacological", "Drugs", "Advisory", "Committee", "of", "the", "FDA", ",", "as", "well", "as", "consultant", "for", "the", "Orphan", "Products", "Development", "Review", "Group", ",", "FDA", ".", "She", "is", "a", "member", "of", "the", "Advisory", "Board", "of", "the", "Brain", "and", "Behavioral", "Research", "Foundation", "(", "NARSAD", ")", ".", "She", "is", "currently", "the", "Deputy", "Editor", "of", "the", "American", "Journal", "of", "Psychiatry", "and", "on", "the", "editorial", "board", "of", "several", "other", "journals", "in", "the", "field", ".", "Dr", ".", "Tamminga", "was", "elected", "to", "the", "Institute", "of", "Medicine", "of", "the", "National", "Academies", "of", "Sciences", "in", "1998", "and", "has", "served", "on", "several", "IOM", "committees", "in", "that", "capacity", ".", "The", "goal", "of", "Dr", ".", "Tammingas", "research", "is", "to", "examine", "and", "understand", "the", "mechanisms", "underlying", "schizophrenia", ",", "especially", "its", "most", "prominent", "symptoms", ",", "psychosis", "and", "memory", "dysfunction", ",", "in", "order", "to", "build", "rational", "treatments", "for", "the", "illness", ".", "She", "evaluates", "the", "function", "of", "the", "living", "human", "brain", "in", "individuals", "with", "and", "without", "schizophrenia", ",", "using", "brain", "imaging", "techniques", ".", "Then", ",", "building", "on", "this", "knowledge", ",", "she", "uses", "human", "postmortem", "brain", "tissue", "to", "translate", "the", "functional", "alterations", "from", "the", "living", "human", "patient", "into", "molecular", "observations", "of", "the", "illness", ".", "Her", "ultimate", "goal", "is", "to", "base", "novel", "pharmacologies", "for", "psychosis", "and", "memory", "dysfunction", "on", "these", "observations", "and", "to", "use", "the", "altered", "in", "vivo", "imaging", "and", "postmortem", "molecular", "changes", "as", "biomarkers", "and", "targets", "for", "identifying", "animal", "models", "of", "disease", "and", "novel", "active", "pharmaceuticals", "."], "record": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_0> take office <extra_id_5> the Lou and Ellen McGinley Distinguished Chair <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> take office <extra_id_5> the McKenzie Chair in Psychiatry at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical School <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> take office <extra_id_5> the Chairman of the Department of Psychiatry and the Chief of the Translational Neuroscience Division in Schizophrenia at UTSW <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> gender <extra_id_5> She <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> highest education <extra_id_5> M .

{"text": "Mahendra Kumar Trivedi completed his 5 - year Bachelors degree in Mechanical Engineering in 1985 and has worked as an Engineer for 10 years . In 1995 , Mr . Trivedi discovered his unique ability to harness the energy from the universe and transmit it to anywhere on the globe , infusing it into living organisms and nonliving materials , thus optimizing their potential . For the next 5 - 7 years , Trivedi applied this newfound discovery to helping people optimize their potential , and this unique phenomenon resulting from Mr . Trivedis biofield energy treatments became internationally renown as The Trivedi Effect . We have met many major and world - renowned scientists and other individuals that are identified as experts in the areas of consciousness and biofield energy , each with their own interpretation or assessment of the nature or origin of The Trivedi Effect through the lens of their personal knowledge and expertise . Currently we are not attempting to explain the nature and origin of this energy as we find it does not fit into any existing beliefs or paradigms available on this planet . However , by way of scientific verification , we are aware that its impacts are universal and can be applied to both living and non - living substances with seemingly limitless capacity that has exceedingly wide - reaching applications for the betterment of the world .

{"text": "I am currently a full professor of networked systems and a founding director of the institute for networked systems at RWTH Aachen University . Previously I held an Ericsson Chair of Wireless Networks also at the RWTH Aachen . Before joining to RWTH Aachen in 2002 , I was a professor and research director at the Centre for Wireless Communications , Finland . I have studied and worked in the United States , the United Kingdom and Scandinavia . Why Aachen ? Lets call it optimal climate for scientific work . My personal experimentation has proved that Aachen , in fact , has rather perfect conditions . It is significantly warmer than Scandinavia ( good ) . There are true seasons , which suits for me better than California ( great , although we do not have Napa Valley vineyards , but I do not miss any Bay rush hours either ) , and believe - it - or - not it rains less in Aachen than in my old hometown Oxford . Why academia ? I am fundamentally researcher who wants to thinker with both theoretical and practical problems . Although I have experience from industrial projects and have participated in different roles in start - up companies ( mainly started by my students ) , I feel best in the academic environment where one is free from commercial and corporate pressures . I am rather old fashioned academic , who believes these old and sometimes unfashionable ideas of academic freedom , research based teaching , and not having conflicts of interests . My present research interests include cognitive wireless networks , embedded intelligence in IoT systems , theory of complex networks , future network architectures , and more generally optimized and adaptive wireless communications . I am mostly working at OSI - layers 2 - 4 , but a considerable amount of my work is more general methodology research which includes systems design , systems modeling and theoretical aspects . Publishing ? Yes , I publish with my students . But I will not bore you with numbers , which is not a particularly interesting topic . You will find even less talk about my third - party funding success . Our institute ' s work is relatively highly cited . The most satisfying results in the academia ? My graduated students , both Ph . D and M . Sc . They have been able to literally span the globule , e . g . in North - to - South direction they have spread between Finland and New Zealand . This is made somewhat understandable since I have had students with over 30 different nationalities . Some of them are continuing in academia , the first ones have already their own professorships , others are busy in industry or working in governmental organisations . . . few of them are busily building their own companies .", "tokens": ["I", "am", "currently", "a", "full", "professor", "of", "networked", "systems", "and", "a", "founding", "director", "of", "the", "institute", "for",

{"text": "Dr . Terry E . Robinson was raised and educated in Canada , and in 1978 received his Ph . D . in Psychology ( Biopsychology ) from the University of Western Ontario , in London , Ontario . After postdoctoral training at the University of California at Irvine he assumed a position as Assistant Professor of Psychology in Biopsychology at The University of Michigan in Ann Arbor . He has served as Chair of the Biopsychology Program and Director of the Neuroscience Program . Dr . Robinson is known internationally for his research concerning the persistent behavioral and neurobiological consequences of repeated psychostimulant drug use , and the implications of these for addiction and relapse . His present research focuses on individual differences in the propensity to attribute incentive motivational properties to cues associated with rewards ( e . g . , food or drugs ) , and how this may predispose some individuals to develop impulse control disorders , such as addiction . He has published over 220 articles , and his papers have been cited over 31 , 000 times ( h=81 ; since 2006 he has been listed on ISIHighlyCited . com as one of the highest cited [ top 0 . 5% ] scientists in Neuroscience ) . He has held a NIH Research Career Development Award , a NIDA Senior Scientist Award , a NIDA - funded MERIT Award and is currently PI on a Program Project grant from NIDA and a Project Director on a P50 Centers of Excellence Award from NIDA . Dr . Robinson is a Fellow of the AAAS , a Charter Fellow of the American Psychological Society ( APS ) , a member of the American College of Neuropsychopharmacology ( ACNP ) and is currently President - Elect of the European Behavioral Pharmacology Society ( EBPS ) .

{"text": "I am an ISI Highly Cited Researcher , a Visiting Professor at Imperial college , and a Fellow of Academia Europaea . From 2000 - 2011 I served as Secretary of the Zoological Society of London ( constitutionally the Chief Executive responsible for London and Whipsnade Zoos , the Institute of Zoology and the Conservation Programmes ) . From 1998 - 2011 I was Head of the Department of Zoology at Oxford . I use cross - taxon or cross - individual comparisons to answer questions about biological processes , usually in the fields of evolution , behaviour and ecology . Cross - taxon comparisons are used , together with phylogenetic information , to reveal characters on an evolutionary tree that tend to evolve together and are functionally related for example in mammals large testes size , high sperm counts and mating systems that involve sperm competition . Such studies are done within a formal hypothesis - testing statistical framework that controls for non - independence . Cross - individual comparisons use gene sequence data , usually from viruses , to reveal the population dynamic or epidemiological history of diseases . With colleagues , I have been able to use gene sequence data from individuals from non - recombining populations ( e . g . Hepatitis C ) to calculate the reproductive number , which underpins more recent theoretical and practical understanding of epidemiological histories . The cross - taxon studies have usually involved vertebrates , mammals and birds in particular , while the cross - individual comparisons have concentrated on viruses . For the most part , advances in biological understanding have followed the development of appropriate statistical techniques that have then become more widely used by other workers in the field .

{"text": "Born in 1912 , in Frankfurt , Germany , Gertie obtained her primary and secondary education in her hometown , and in 1931 , entered the Medical School of the University of Frankfurt . With the rise of Nazism , Gertie was forced to transfer to the University of Bern , Switzerland , from which she received an M . D . degree in February 1937 . She immigrated to the United States two months later . Her postgraduate training began with a rotating internship at Beth Israel Hospital in New York City . Women physicians were not exactly welcome in those days , and Gertie was accepted only after a male candidate backed out of his contract at the last minute . Thus she became the only female among 24 interns . Her four - month rotation in surgery proved decisive in her career choice . Not being strong enough to hold retractors during surgery , she was promptly relegated to anesthesiology , which was an integral part of the surgical rotation . Although her original goal was to become a pediatrician , Gertie fell in love with anesthesiology . She applied and was accepted into the newly approved residency program at Beth Israel . Following her appointment to the attending staff at the same hospital , Gertie introduced the technique of caudal block , which she learned from Robert A . Hingson , M . D . This was the beginning of her devotion to regional anesthesia in obstetrics . Four years later , she officially became the Director of Obstetric Anesthesia and remained in that position until 1955 when she moved to the brand - new Albert Einstein College of Medicine in the Bronx . The obstetric service had not opened yet , and Gertie worked full - time in the surgical unit . She was even instrumental in starting the anesthetic program for open - heart surgery . Only one and one - half years later was she able to return to her \" true love , \" taking care of parturients , teaching residents and pursuing clinical research . She excelled in all these endeavors until her retirement in 1995 . In dealing with residents and her numerous fellows , Gertie was a demanding taskmaster but always willing to help them in difficult life situations . With many , she developed a lasting friendship . Her colleagues appreciated Gertie ' s forthright personality and scrupulous honesty . Among the many contributions Gertie made , three had the most profound and lasting effects on obstetric anesthesia practice , namely , acute hydration for prevention of postspinal hypotension , studies of the aorto - caval compression and the use of regional anesthesia for emergency cesarean sections . Gertie authored or co - authored approximately 150 original articles and 30 textbooks and book chapters . In 1981 she became the first editor of Obstetric Anesthesia Digest . Gertie received numerous honors and awards , including the Distinguished Service Award from ASA in 1988 and from the American Society of Regional Anesthesia ( ASRA ) in 1990 . The one she was most proud of was a medal from the Royal College of Anaesthetists presented to her by Queen Elizabeth II in 1993 .", "tokens": ["Born", "in", "1912", ",", "in", "Frankfurt", ",",

Honorary Professor at the Universities of Buenos Aires , Alabama at Birmingham , Pittsburgh and Vanderbilt . Awarded the national prizes in research in Biology ( 1996 ) , Basic Sciences ( 1999 ) and Science and Technology ( 2007 ) . International honors include Senior Fulbright Foreign Scholar , Guggenheim Fellow , Howard Hughes Medical Institute Alumni , Alexander Von Humboldt Award , Discovery Award of the Society for Free Radical Biology and Medicine and Luis Federico Leloir Award to International Scientific Cooperation . Member of The Academy of Sciences for the Developing World ( TWAS ) , the Argentinean National Academy of Sciences , the Brazilian Academy of Sciences , the Latin American Academy of Sciences , Founder Member and First Secretary of the Uruguayan National Academy of Sciences , Honorary Member of the Uruguayan National Academy of Medicine and Foreign Associate of the US National Academy of Sciences . Member of the Council of Scientific Advisors of the International Center of Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology ( ICGEB ) . Former President of the Society for Free Radical Biology and Medicine . Current President of the Society for Free Radical Research International . Research Interests Radis research activities have focused on the biochemistry , cell biology , relevance to disease mechanisms and therapeutics of free radicals , oxidants and antioxidant systems . In particular , Radi has contributed to clarify the mechanisms of nitric oxide - dependent toxicity through its interaction with superoxide and the formation of peroxynitrite in vitro and in vivo . He has extensively characterized the biological chemistry of peroxynitrite , including the discovery of free radical - dependent and independent reaction pathways , its impact in mitochondrial dysfunction and apoptosis via oxidation and nitration reactions and its role in pathology . He has contributed to the concept that an oxidizing environment can shift the physiological actions of nitric oxide towards pathophysiology . Radis work facilitated the development , testing and chemical characterization of antioxidants that serve as peroxynitrite decomposition catalysts as well as mitochondrial - targeted redox - based drugs for application in cardiovascular , neurodegenerative and inflammatory conditions . Additionally , Radi has shown that peroxynitrite is a cytotoxic effector in cellular immune responses against intracellular pathogens such as the causative agent of Chagas disease , Trypanosoma cruzi , and how microbial antioxidant systems constitute virulence factors . He has authored over 210 peer - review papers and 40 reviews , with an h - index = 72 ( ISI , Feb 2016 ) and over 22 , 000 citations .", "tokens": ["Rafael", "Radi", ",", "MD", ",", "PhD", "(",

{"text": "The entrance to the Program of Cooperation between the National Academy of Sciences ( NAS - USA ) and CNPq - National Council for Scientific and Technological Development , in 1970 , marked the beginning of his scientific career . Under the supervision of Professors John Malis and Henry Taube ( University of Stanford - Nobel Prize 1983 ) , Toma concluded his Ph . D . in 1974 , and since then , proceeded to direct a research group at the \" Instituto de Qumica \" of the \" Universidade de So Paulo \" ( USP ) , developing new research projects on the kinetics and mechanisms of inorganic reactions . Still in this decade , he entered the field of electron transfer and of bioinorganic chemistry , by means of postdoctoral training periods , with Professors Norman Sutin and Carol Creutz ( Brookhaven National Laboratory ) in 1976 , and with Professor Harry B . Gray ( California Institute of Technology ) in 1979 . The work produced in this phase marked him , putting his Research Group within the one of largest impact , from the Third World , according to evaluation performed by the Institute of Scientific Information . In the eighties his research focused on the chemical reactivity of metaloenzymes and synthetic macrocyclic compounds , following the world tendency to direct research to frontier regions with Bioinorganic Chemistry . At the end of the decade , the work of incorporation of redox centers to metaloenzymes inspired his current research line , focused on the supermolecules project and the development of Supramolecular Chemistry . This research line still has futuristic concepts . The approach , in particular , has been based on the coupling of chemical species following a typical design of molecular engineering , which has permitted to project complex and rational structures for the use of electrochemical , optical and Molecular electronic devices . In this view , the recent work succeeded in designing supermolecules derived from porfirins , clusters and macrocyclic compounds , capable of promoting processes of multilectronic transference , mimicking , for example , enzymes of the respiratory chain and biomolecules that fixate carbon monoxide . These molecules were used in the elaboration of films with electric conduction , photoconduction and electroanalytical properties , as well as in the development of chemo - and biosensors .", "tokens": ["The", "entrance", "to", "the", "Program", "of", "Cooperation", "between", "the", "National", "Academy", "of", "Sciences", "(", "NAS", "-", "USA", ")", "and", "CNPq", "-", "National", "Council", "for", "Scientific", "and", "Technological", "Development", ",", "in", "1970", ",", "marked", "the", "beginning", "of", "his", "scientific", "career", ".", "Under", "the", "supervision", "of", "Professors", "John", "Malis", "and", "Henry", "Taube", "(", "University", "of", "Stanford", "-", "Nobel", "Prize", "1983", ")", ",", "Toma", "concluded", "his", "Ph", ".", "D", ".", "in", "1974", ",", "and", "since", "then", ",", "proceeded", "to", "direct", "a", "research", "group", "at", "the", "\"", "Instituto", "de", "Qumica", "\"", "of", "the", "\"", "Universidade", "de", "So", "Paulo", "\"", "(", "USP", ")", ",", "developing", "new", "research", "projects", "on", "the", "kinetics", "and", "mechanisms", "of", "inorganic", "reactions", ".", "Still", "in", "this", "decade", ",", "he", "entered", "the", "field", "of", "electron", "transfer", "and", "of", "bioinorganic", "chemistry", ",", "by", "means", "of", "postdoctoral", "training", "periods", ",", "with", "Professors", "Norman", "Sutin", "and", "Carol", "Creutz", "(", "Brookhaven", "National", "Laboratory", ")", "in", "1976", ",", "and", "with", "Professor", "Harry", "B", ".", "Gray", "(", "California", "Institute", "of", "Technology", ")", "in", "1979", ".", "The", "work", "produced", "in", "this", "phase", "marked", "him", ",", "putting", "his", "Research", "Group", "within", "the", "one", "of", "largest", "impact", ",", "from", "the", "Third", "World", ",", "according", "to", "evaluation", "performed", "by", "the", "Institute", "of", "Scientific", "Information", ".", "In", "the", "eighties", "his", "research", "focused", "on", "the", "chemical", "reactivity", "of", "metaloenzymes", "and", "synthetic", "macrocyclic", "compounds", ",", "following", "the", "world", "tendency", "to", "direct", "research", "to", "frontier", "regions", "with", "Bioinorganic", "Chemistry", ".", "At", "the", "end", "of", "the", "decade", ",", "the", "work", "of", "incorporation", "of", "redox", "centers", "to", "metaloenzymes", "inspired", "his", "current", "research", "line", ",", "focused", "on", "the", "supermolecules", "project", "and", "the", "development", "of", "Supramolecular", "Chemistry", ".", "This", "research", "line", "still", "has", "futuristic", "concepts", ".", "The", "approach", ",", "in", "particular", ",", "has", "been", "based", "on", "the", "coupling", "of", "chemical", "species", "following", "a", "typical", "design", "of", "molecular", "engineering", ",", "which", "has", "permitted", "to", "project", "complex", "and", "rational", "structures", "for", "the", "use", "of", "electrochemical", ",", "optical", "and", "Molecular", "electronic", "devices", ".", "In", "this", "view", ",", "the", "recent", "work", "succeeded", "in", "designing", "supermolecules", "derived", "from", "porfirins", ",", "clusters", "and", "macrocyclic", "compounds", ",", "capable", "of", "promoting", "processes", "of", "multilectronic", "transference", ",", "mimicking", ",", "for", "example", ",", "enzymes", "of", "the", "respiratory", "chain", "and", "biomolecules", "that", "fixate", "carbon", "monoxide", ".", "These", "molecules", "were", "used", "in", "the", "elaboration", "of", "films", "with", "electric", "conduction", ",", "photoconduction", "and", "electroanalytical", "properties", ",", "as", "well", "as", "in", "the", "development", "of", "chemo", "-", "and", "biosensors", "."], "record": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_0> highest education <extra_id_5> Ph .

{"text": "I grew up on a dairy farm in northern Wisconsin ( near Wulff valley ) . I first became interested in chemistry one day when my father was feeding the pigs . In order to prevent problems with intestinal worms , copper sulfate was added to their feed . I was enamored with the beautiful blue crystals that he was sprinkling in the feed tray and asked what it was . I was only about eight and thus the answer copper sulfate was no more than a strange alien name , but somehow I got the impression that its name meant something about why it was blue . My father gave me a few crystals to keep and the next Christmas , a chemistry set . I was hooked . Also about the same time I decided that I had to be a Professor at a University since the new medium of television portrayed chemistry as a highly noble and respected profession ( Sputnik had an enormous positive effect on science in general in the late fifties and sixties ) . The important lessons about how to be a successful scientist I would think are usually learned the hard way . In my case they certainly were . These lessons also of course could not be learned without dedicated teachers that one encounters along the way . My High School Chemistry teacher , Mr . Schwartz , was actually a biologist filling in because of a retirement . Although he did not know a lot of chemistry , he was dedicated to helping students learn . He once picked me up at 4 : 00 AM and drove me across the state for a High School Chemistry fair . I had prepared a talk on an experiment that I had repeated from a Chemistry book . I was embarrassed to find that everyone elses talk involved original experiments . The lesson learned from this is that science is about doing something new .", "tokens": ["I", "grew", "up", "on", "a", "dairy", "farm", "in", "northern", "Wisconsin", "(", "near", "Wulff", "valley", ")", ".", "I", "first", "became", "interested", "in", "chemistry", "one", "day", "when", "my", "father", "was", "feeding", "the", "pigs", ".", "In", "order", "to", "prevent", "problems", "with", "intestinal", "worms", ",", "copper", "sulfate", "was", "added", "to", "their", "feed", ".", "I", "was", "enamored", "with", "the", "beautiful", "blue", "crystals", "that", "he", "was", "sprinkling", "in", "the", "feed", "tray", "and", "asked", "what", "it", "was", ".", "I", "was", "only", "about", "eight", "and", "thus", "the", "answer", "copper", "sulfate", "was", "no", "more", "than", "a", "strange", "alien", "name", ",", "but", "somehow", "I", "got", "the", "impression", "that", "its", "name", "meant", "something", "about", "why", "it", "was", "blue", ".", "My", "father", "gave", "me", "a", "few", "crystals", "to", "keep", "and", "the", "next", "Christmas", ",", "a", "chemistry", "set", ".", "I", "was", "hooked", ".", "Also", "about", "the", "same", "time", "I", "decided", "that", "I", "had", "to", "be", "a", "Professor", "at", "a", "University", "since", "the", "new", "medium", "of", "television", "portrayed", "chemistry", "as", "a", "highly", "noble", "and", "respected", "profession", "(", "Sputnik", "had", "an", "enormous", "positive", "effect", "on", "science", "in", "general", "in", "the", "late", "fifties", "and", "sixties", ")", ".", "The", "important", "lessons", "about", "how", "to", "be", "a", "successful", "scientist", "I", "would", "think", "are", "usually", "learned", "the", "hard", "way", ".", "In", "my", "case", "they", "certainly", "were", ".", "These", "lessons", "also", "of", "course", "could", "not", "be", "learned", "without", "dedicated", "teachers", "that", "one", "encounters", "along", "the", "way", ".", "My", "High", "School", "Chemistry", "teacher", ",", "Mr", ".", "Schwartz", ",", "was", "actually", "a", "biologist", "filling", "in", "because", "of", "a", "retirement", ".", "Although", "he", "did", "not", "know", "a", "lot", "of", "chemistry", ",", "he", "was", "dedicated", "to", "helping", "students", "learn", ".", "He", "once", "picked", "me", "up", "at", "4", ":", "00", "AM", "and", "drove", "me", "across", "the", "state", "for", "a", "High", "School", "Chemistry", "fair", ".", "I", "had", "prepared", "a", "talk", "on", "an", "experiment", "that", "I", "had", "repeated", "from", "a", "Chemistry", "book", ".", "I", "was", "embarrassed", "to", "find", "that", "everyone", "elses", "talk", "involved", "original", "experiments", ".", "The", "lesson", "learned", "from", "this", "is", "that", "science", "is", "about", "doing", "something", "new", "."], "record": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_0> research interests <extra_id_5> chemistry <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1>", "entity": [{"type": "research interests", "offset": [21], "text": "chemistry"}], "relation": [], "event": [], "spot": ["research interests"], "asoc": [], "spot_asoc": [{"span": "chemistry", "label": "research interests", "asoc": []}]}

{"text": "Lars Terenius is a neurobiologist whose research focuses on neurogenetics and psychiatric diseases , and on alcohol and drug dependence . He was the first to show that certain small peptides , produced naturally in the body , act on the brain ' s opiate receptors in a manner similar to that of other opiates . This discovery helped elucidate the pharmacological effects of opiates and other painkillers , widely used in the practice of medicine . It also gave important insights into the chemistry of the brain , helping researchers to better understand the origins of some mental disorders resulting from chemical imbalances . A current research focus is molecular imaging using advanced technologies including FCS ( fluorescence correlation spectroscopy ) to study the molecular dynamics an interactions in the living cell . Lars Terenius is Professor Emeritus in the Department of Clinical Neuroscience at the Karolinska Institutet , and has over 500 publications on various topics including chronic pain , drug and alcohol dependence and psychosis . He is also the Founding Director of the Center for Molecular Medicine , a center for studies of disease mechanisms as a way to improved diagnosis and treatment , with about 400 scientists , situated at the Karolinska University Hospital , Solna . He was a member of the State of the Science Committee on Child and Adolescent Mental Health organized by the Swedish Royal Academy of Sciences . Dr Terenius earned his PhD in medical pharmacology from the University of Uppsala in 1969 and has taught there , at the Karolinska Institutet and at the Scripps Research Institute where he is also Professor of Molecular and Cellular Neuroscience . He has held visiting professorships at the National Institute for Medical Research , London , Rockefeller University , Harvard University , the University of Aberdeen , Hebrew University in Jerusalem and the Neurosciences Institute in San Diego .

{"text": "I grew up on a small farm in Waterbury Center , Vermont . I spent a lot of time in agricultural pursuits including harvesting hay and making maple syrup ( cliche , I know ) . I also played a lot of bassoon . My high school math teacher suggested I go to Oberlin College , so I did . After completing a degree in chemistry in 1985 , I tried my hand at public health ( somewhat of a family business ) . I found , however , that I didn ' t enjoy dealing with the public ( around health ) and so returned to science . My Ph . D . study with Jim Anderson was a long , drawnout and totally enjoyable affair - - I started out working in the laboratory on kinetics of gas - phase radicals ( with Phil Stevens , Darin Toohey and Jon Abbatt ) before being drawn into the field . I worked with Rick Stimpfle and Larry Lapson on a crazy experiment measuring the hydroxyl radical ( OH ) abundance in the stratosphere by laser induced fluorescence ( imagine a battery powered , copper - vapor laser pumping a dye laser all dangling from a hellium balloon at 30 km altitude ) . Three long summers in Palistine , Texas , was not punishment enough and so I began a new project ( together with Ron Cohen and Tom Hanisco ) to measure OH from NASA ' s ER - 2 aircraft . I learned that planes are much better than balloons for doing this science . I also learned just how important great engineering and technical staff are ( thank you Norton Allen , Joe Demusz , Nate Hazen , Larry Lapson , and Jim Oliver ) . Finally , I received my Ph . D . in Physcial Chemistry in 1994 . I also met my wife , Cheryl , during this time ( in a laundrymat of all places ) . After a few years hanging on at Harvard ( during which my daughter Janna was born ) I moved to Caltech . I quickly learned that Caltech is an awesome place to be a scientist . I continued to work on aircraft instrumentation as well as new efforts to measure atmospheric composition from the ground ( TCCON ) and from space ( OCO , and the ill - fated MATMOS ) ( and , Emma joined our family ) . I have had many fantastic students and postdocs work with me - - please see their individual pages on the group research page .

{"text": "Birte Svensson is professor ( 2004 ) at Enzyme and Protein Chemistry , Department of Systems Biology , the Technical University of Denmark . She obtained her M . Sc . ( 1970 ) and Ph . D . ( 1974 ) from University of Copenhagen , Denmark , making thesis projects on immobilisation and chemical modification of subtilisins at the Carlsberg Laboratory , supervised by Martin Ottesen and Hans H . Ussing . She was post - doctoral fellow first at Institut Pasteur in Paris ( 1974 ) working with Borivoj Keil on structure / function relationships of chymotrypsin and collagenases and then at Department of Biochemistry , University of Copenhagen , working on integral intestinal brush border peptidases . Returning to the Carlsberg Laboratory in the late 70 ' ies she started to work on fungal beta - glucanase and in 1980 took up purification and sequencing of glucoamylase ( GH15 ) from Aspergillus niger and identified one of the first very longer highly O - glycosylated linkers as well as one of the first carbohydrate binding modules , the starch binding domain ( of CBM20 ) . This was followed by identification of essential substrate binding tryptophans and catalytic site residues using differential chemical labelling followed by further analysis using site - directed mutagenesis and ITC for binding of active site inhibitors ( incl . acarbose ) and beta - cyclodextrin to the SBD . She crystallised barley alpha - amylase ( GH13 ) in the mid 80 ' ies and the structure was determined in Richard Haser ' s group ( in Marseille and Lyon ) . This was followed by protein engineering and mutational analysis studies of structure / function relationships of a couple of isozymes and analysis of the interaction with a proteinaceous inhibitor ( barley alpha - amylase / subtilisin inhibitor ) using ITC and SPR . She has examined the structural basis for processivity , subsite binding energy profiles and secondary surface binding sites and their role in activity and interaction with polysaccharides and starch granules . Recent work includes the starch debranching enzyme limit dextrinase ( GH13 ) , its specificity and interaction with a proteinaceous inhibitor . She is currently also engaged in discovery of enzymes and transporters involved in utilisation of carbohydrate prebiotics by probiotic bacteria and in chemoenzymatic transglycosylation for production of novel oligosaccharides . She has worked with evolution of GH13 and written several reviews . Besides the field of carbohydrate - active enzymes , she works on cereal proteomics .

After which he joined Dr . Joseph E . Murray as his second fellow in the newly established program at the Harvard Medical School that encompassed all the hospitals of the Harvard Medical School in Boston - ( Peter Bent Brigham , Childrens , Mass General , Beth Israel , and Deaconess Hospitals ) . Upon completion with Dr . Murray as his mentor and program director in Plastic and Reconstructive surgery , Dr . Habal became chief of the pediatric section at the University of Indiana Childrens Hospital . In 1974 , Dr . Habal moved to Florida where he did the first craniofacial procedures , first for the Midwest in Indiana and then in the Southeast at the University of Florida . The American College of Surgeons invited him to do a clinic on orbital hypertelorism correction , for which the classical procedure still remains today , forty years later . Dr . Habal then moved to the University of South Florida in Tampa , as the program chairman , chief of service , and professor in the department of surgery . In the early 80s Dr . Habal moved his craniofacial center as a private unit affiliated with the University so that the operations on that unit will be totally under the control of the Tampa Bay Craniofacial Foundation . Dr . Habal has done craniofacial surgery and the wide scope of plastic surgery since he finished his training and he continues to write , edit and educate medical students , residents , and fellows in plastic surgery .

{"text": "After teaching high school science for two years , I decided that I wanted to do more with my background in biology , chemistry and physics , and decided to enroll in the graduate program in Biophysical Sciences at the University of Houston . I would never have guessed that this would lead to a dissertation on the biochemical and behavioral effects of marihuana in mice and rats . Unpredictable career paths are common in science . I was then recruited to the Medical College of Virginia ( VCU ) to continue this work as a postdoctoral fellow by Drs . William Dewey and Louis Harris where I learned how to use the principles of classical structure activity relationships to understand the pharmacological basis of both behavioral and biochemical effects of various cannabinoids found in marihuana , as well as some of the metabolites of marihuana found in humans . The use of basic structure activity relationships remains at the heart of my research in several areas of investigation in my lab today . The current focus in my laboratory is on finding novel approaches for the treatment of schizophrenia . To this end , we have discovered that treatment of very young rat pups with phencyclidine ( PCP , angel dust ) causes symptoms later in development that mimic many of the signs of schizophrenia . Experiments using pharmacological antagonism have shown that these behavioral deficits are related to the apoptotic effects of PCP in very specific brain regions . Unlike necrosis , apoptosis is a mechanism by which cells die in a very orderly and relatively slow fashion . By using specific information about the mechanism ( s ) of neuronal death , we are using pharmacological approaches to disrupt this process , and then correlating these data with the behavioral effects observed . To date , we have observed that pharmacological activation of specific calcium conductance channels is able to prevent the apoptotic effects of PCP . Collaboration with chemists at the University of Illinois - Chicago and here at UTMB has led to the synthesis of new molecules that can ameliorate the neurotoxic effects of PCP . Our ultimate goal is to turn these leads into novel pharmacotherapeutic molecules for the treatment of schizophrenia .", "tokens": ["After", "teaching", "high", "school", "science", "for", "two",

{"text": "Samuel French is a liver pathologist and scientist who has been on faculty at the UCLA Department of Pathology since 2002 . Dr . French earned his B . A . in Biophysics at U . C . Berkeley and M . D . and Ph . D . in Biochemistry at the University of Pittsburgh . He completed his residency in Pathology at UCLA as well as fellowship in gastrointestinal / liver pathology . He was a postdoctoral fellow at ucla where he worked on lymphomagenesis . He is a recipien of the Boyer - Parvin Postdoctoral Recognition Award and Cure Named New Investigator Award . Dr . French is currently developing a proteomic based program to study the developoment of liver cancer from hepatitis C viral infection . Research Interests Hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) is the third most common cause of cancer related death worldwide . One of most common causes of HCC includes infection with hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) in association with cirrhosis . We study the impact of HCV on hepatocyte cell signaling that augments viral infection and promotes hepatocarcinogenesis . We primarily utilize a proteomic approach to identify pathways targeted by HCV . The HCV encoded NS5A and CORE proteins appear to alter cell growth and are reported to protect cells from apoptosis . We hypothesize Core and NS5A alter hepatocyte signaling pathways that promote HCV infection and lead to development of hepatocellular carcinoma . Through coimmunoprecipitation , we have recently identified NS5A in complex with heat shock proteins ( HSP ) s that we term the NS5A / HSP complex . Formation of the NS5A / HSP complex may significantly alter cell signaling , facilitate viral replication , and be tumorigenic . We have found that the HSP synthesis inhibitor Quercetin markedly reduces HCV infection in tissue culture and we are now initiating a phase one clinical trial to determine Quercetin ? s safety and efficacy in subjection with chronic HCV infection . Identification and elucidation of novel pathways affected by HCV will allow biomarker development and non - toxic drug design to treat and prevent HCV as well as HCC .

{"text": "Ernest L . Eliel , one of Carolina Chemistry ' s most notable and loved faculty members passed away on September 18th , 2008 . Ernest Eliel had a far - reaching impact on chemistry , science , science policy , and people . He was one of those rare individuals who cared deeply about all aspects of what he did and was able to quietly influence all those things in a positive way . Ernest Eliel was born in Cologne , Germany , in 1921 . During WWII he fled to Scotland , Canada , and eventually Cuba , where he began graduate studies at the University of Havana . He came to the United States after the war and obtained his Ph . D degree from the University of Illinois . Eliel joined the faculty of Notre Dame in 1948 , where he was the head of the chemistry department from 1964 through 1966 . He came to the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill as a William Rand Kenan , Jr . , professor in 1972 . His interest in stereochemistry and conformational analysis led to several well - known textbooks . In 1962 he wrote \" Stereochemistry of Carbon Compounds , \" the first treatise to organize and focus attention on the emerging field of stereochemistry . In 2000 he was the primary author of \" Stereochemistry of Organic Compounds , \" arguably the most complete treatise of what has by now , and much thanks to his effort , become a well - established , highly important field . Some of professor Eliel ' s many awards , accomplishments , and recognitions , include being a member of the National Academy of Sciences , a Guggenheim Fellow , and receiving the Lavoisier Medal of the Chemical Society of France . He served as President of the American Chemical Society , and received its highest recognition , the Priestley Medal , in 1995 . Ernest Eliel was a giant in his field who was always gracious and generous with his time . His science and his personality have had an immeasurable impact on the UNC Department of Chemistry . He espoused and contributed to the highly collegial nature of the department , and though we will certainly miss him , his spirit will always be with us because of the great influence that he had on so many people here .", "tokens": ["Ernest", "L", ".", "Eliel", ",", "one", "of", "Carolina", "Chemistry", "'", "s", "most", "notable", "and", "loved", "faculty", "members", "passed", "away", "on", "September", "18th", ",", "2008", ".", "Ernest", "Eliel", "had", "a", "far", "-", "reaching", "impact", "on", "chemistry", ",", "science", ",", "science", "policy", ",", "and", "people", ".", "He", "was", "one", "of", "those", "rare", "individuals", "who", "cared", "deeply", "about", "all", "aspects", "of", "what", "he", "did", "and", "was", "able", "to", "quietly", "influence", "all", "those", "things", "in", "a", "positive", "way", ".", "Ernest", "Eliel", "was", "born", "in", "Cologne", ",", "Germany", ",", "in", "1921", ".", "During", "WWII", "he", "fled", "to", "Scotland", ",", "Canada", ",", "and", "eventually", "Cuba", ",", "where", "he", "began", "graduate", "studies", "at", "the", "University", "of", "Havana", ".", "He", "came", "to", "the", "United", "States", "after", "the", "war", "and", "obtained", "his", "Ph", ".", "D", "degree", "from", "the", "University", "of", "Illinois", ".", "Eliel", "joined", "the", "faculty", "of", "Notre", "Dame", "in", "1948", ",", "where", "he", "was", "the", "head", "of", "the", "chemistry", "department", "from", "1964", "through", "1966", ".", "He", "came", "to", "the", "University", "of", "North", "Carolina", "at", "Chapel", "Hill", "as", "a", "William", "Rand", "Kenan", ",", "Jr", ".", ",", "professor", "in", "1972", ".", "His", "interest", "in", "stereochemistry", "and", "conformational", "analysis", "led", "to", "several", "well", "-", "known", "textbooks", ".", "In", "1962", "he", "wrote", "\"", "Stereochemistry", "of", "Carbon", "Compounds", ",", "\"", "the", "first", "treatise", "to", "organize", "and", "focus", "attention", "on", "the", "emerging", "field", "of", "stereochemistry", ".", "In", "2000", "he", "was", "the", "primary", "author", "of", "\"", "Stereochemistry", "of", "Organic", "Compounds", ",", "\"", "arguably", "the", "most", "complete", "treatise", "of", "what", "has", "by", "now", ",", "and", "much", "thanks", "to", "his", "effort", ",", "become", "a", "well", "-", "established", ",", "highly", "important", "field", ".", "Some", "of", "professor", "Eliel", "'", "s", "many", "awards", ",", "accomplishments", ",", "and", "recognitions", ",", "include", "being", "a", "member", "of", "the", "National", "Academy", "of", "Sciences", ",", "a", "Guggenheim", "Fellow", ",", "and", "receiving", "the", "Lavoisier", "Medal", "of", "the", "Chemical", "Society", "of", "France", ".", "He", "served", "as", "President", "of", "the", "American", "Chemical", "Society", ",", "and", "received", "its", "highest", "recognition", ",", "the", "Priestley", "Medal", ",", "in", "1995", ".", "Ernest", "Eliel", "was", "a", "giant", "in", "his", "field", "who", "was", "always", "gracious", "and", "generous", "with", "his", "time", ".", "His", "science", "and", "his", "personality", "have", "had", "an", "immeasurable", "impact", "on", "the", "UNC", "Department", "of", "Chemistry", ".", "He", "espoused", "and", "contributed", "to", "the", "highly", "collegial", "nature", "of", "the", "department", ",", "and", "though", "we", "will", "certainly", "miss", "him", ",", "his", "spirit", "will", "always", "be", "with", "us", "because", "of", "the", "great", "influence", "that", "he", "had", "on", "so", "many", "people", "here", "."], "record": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_0> gender <extra_id_5> He <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> highest education <extra_id_5> Ph .

{"text": "The main scientific achievements of Prof . Koen Clays are in the field of linear and nonlinear optics of organic molecular and nanostructured materials . Prof . Clays is worldwide recognized for the development of hyper - Rayleigh scattering as a technique for the experimental determination of the second - order nonlinear optical properties of molecular materials . This technique has a number of distinctive advantages that have made it the method of choice in this research field . It can be applied just as well for fast and efficient screening of the libraries of new molecules that become available , as for the validation of new engineering concepts and unique molecular symmetries for second - order effects . Therefore , this nonlinear scattering technique is at the same time pervasive and enabling in the field . It is pervasive , for it is being used in a growing number of laboratories in the world , often with active contribution from the group of Prof . Clays . It is enabling , since it has resulted in paradigm shifts from the early simple neutral and dipolar molecule to much more elaborate symmetries and ionic complexes , allowing also the study of the switching at the molecular level of the optical and nonlinear optical properties of molecules . The truly unique capability of multiphoton fluorescence suppression in nonlinear light scattering , only available in the group of Prof . Clays in Leuven , is the result of his combined expertise in steady - state and time - resolved , linear and nonlinear optical properties of molecular materials . More recently , Prof . Clays has also contributed to the field of nanophotonics , by applying his expertise in optics to nanostructured photonic crystals . His work has shown the possibility for lower threshold lasing and enhanced light harvesting through photonic bandgap engineering . This shows that the research by Prof . Clays is also motivated by societal needs : The nonlinear optical and photonics research is driven by the future needs of in information - based society with optical communication , while the improved light harvesting can contribute to energy needs .", "tokens": ["The", "main", "scientific", "achievements", "of", "Prof", ".", "Koen", "Clays", "are", "in", "the", "field", "of", "linear", "and", "nonlinear", "optics", "of", "organic", "molecular", "and", "nanostructured", "materials", ".", "Prof", ".", "Clays", "is", "worldwide", "recognized", "for", "the", "development", "of", "hyper", "-", "Rayleigh", "scattering", "as", "a", "technique", "for", "the", "experimental", "determination", "of", "the", "second", "-", "order", "nonlinear", "optical", "properties", "of", "molecular", "materials", ".", "This", "technique", "has", "a", "number", "of", "distinctive", "advantages", "that", "have", "made", "it", "the", "method", "of", "choice", "in", "this", "research", "field", ".", "It", "can", "be", "applied", "just", "as", "well", "for", "fast", "and", "efficient", "screening", "of", "the", "libraries", "of", "new", "molecules", "that", "become", "available", ",", "as", "for", "the", "validation", "of", "new", "engineering", "concepts", "and", "unique", "molecular", "symmetries", "for", "second", "-", "order", "effects", ".", "Therefore", ",", "this", "nonlinear", "scattering", "technique", "is", "at", "the", "same", "time", "pervasive", "and", "enabling", "in", "the", "field", ".", "It", "is", "pervasive", ",", "for", "it", "is", "being", "used", "in", "a", "growing", "number", "of", "laboratories", "in", "the", "world", ",", "often", "with", "active", "contribution", "from", "the", "group", "of", "Prof", ".", "Clays", ".", "It", "is", "enabling", ",", "since", "it", "has", "resulted", "in", "paradigm", "shifts", "from", "the", "early", "simple", "neutral", "and", "dipolar", "molecule", "to", "much", "more", "elaborate", "symmetries", "and", "ionic", "complexes", ",", "allowing", "also", "the", "study", "of", "the", "switching", "at", "the", "molecular", "level", "of", "the", "optical", "and", "nonlinear", "optical", "properties", "of", "molecules", ".", "The", "truly", "unique", "capability", "of", "multiphoton", "fluorescence", "suppression", "in", "nonlinear", "light", "scattering", ",", "only", "available", "in", "the", "group", "of", "Prof", ".", "Clays", "in", "Leuven", ",", "is", "the", "result", "of", "his", "combined", "expertise", "in", "steady", "-", "state", "and", "time", "-", "resolved", ",", "linear", "and", "nonlinear", "optical", "properties", "of", "molecular", "materials", ".", "More", "recently", ",", "Prof", ".", "Clays", "has", "also", "contributed", "to", "the", "field", "of", "nanophotonics", ",", "by", "applying", "his", "expertise", "in", "optics", "to", "nanostructured", "photonic", "crystals", ".", "His", "work", "has", "shown", "the", "possibility", "for", "lower", "threshold", "lasing", "and", "enhanced", "light", "harvesting", "through", "photonic", "bandgap", "engineering", ".", "This", "shows", "that", "the", "research", "by", "Prof", ".", "Clays", "is", "also", "motivated", "by", "societal", "needs", ":", "The", "nonlinear", "optical", "and", "photonics", "research", "is", "driven", "by", "the", "future", "needs", "of", "in", "information", "-", "based", "society", "with", "optical", "communication", ",", "while", "the", "improved", "light", "harvesting", "can", "contribute", "to", "energy", "needs", "."], "record": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_0> research interests <extra_id_5> linear and nonlinear optics of organic molecular and nanostructured materials <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> research interests <extra_id_5> the field of nanophotonics <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1>", "entity": [{"type": "research interests", "offset": [14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23], "text": "linear and nonlinear optics of organic molecular and nanostructured materials"}, {"type": "research interests", "offset": [277, 278, 279, 280], "text": "the field of nanophotonics"}], "relation": [], "event": [], "spot": ["research interests"], "asoc": [], "spot_asoc": [{"span": "linear and nonlinear optics of organic molecular and nanostructured materials", "label": "research interests", "asoc": []}, {"span": "the field of nanophotonics", "label": "research interests", "asoc": []}]}
{"text": "Dr . Aaronson is an internationally recognized cancer biologist , who in early studies established the transformation - competent but replication defective nature of mammalian sarcoma viruses and molecularly cloned many of their oncogenes . He and colleagues implicated retroviral - related oncogenes in human cancer through investigations including the initial detection of their expression in human tumors and critical contributions to the demonstration of their involvement in human cancer . His investigations of the v - sis oncogene established the first normal function of an oncogene and the role of oncogenes in growth factor signaling . His discovery of erbB2 as a v - erbB - related gene amplified in a human breast carcinoma and demonstration of its transforming properties paved the way for targeted therapies directed against its product . He isolated KGF ( FGF7 ) , a growth factor with novel epithelial cell specificity and demonstrated its involvement in wound repair . Its successful phase III clinical trial by Amgen for treatment of mucositis , recently led the FDA to approve Kepivance ( KGF ) for treatment of this debilitating side effect of many cancer therapies . Thus , Dr . Aaronson ' s pioneering discoveries have directly led to new therapies for cancer patients . His development and application of stable expression cDNA cloning technology resulted in his identification of new human oncogenes , growth factor receptors , and other genes , which induce transformation or drug resistance . He and colleagues identified the protooncogene product , MET , as the receptor for HGF / Scatter Factor and LRP5 / 6 as the receptor for a novel Wnt antagonist , Dkk1 . This latter discovery paved the way for his recent demonstration with colleagues of a Wnt autocrine transforming mechanism in human malignancies . Dr . Aaronson received his M . D . from UCSF in 1966 . He joined the National Institutes of Health in 1967 and became Chief of the Laboratory of Cellular and Molecular Biology at the National Cancer Institute in 1977 . He joined Mount Sinai in 1994 and is the Jack and Jane B . Aron Professor and Founding Chair , Emeritus of the Department of Oncological Sciences .

{"text": "Billy R . Martin , Ph . D . , chair of the Virginia Commonwealth University School of Medicines Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology , and internationally renowned for his research in understanding addiction and drugs of abuse and how they affect the brain , died Sunday in Richmond . He was 65 . Martin played a prominent role in developing the departments reputation for landmark research in drugs of abuse . For more than 30 years , Martins primary focus was researching the effects of marijuanas principal psychoactive ingredient , delta - 9 - tetrahydrocannabinol , or THC . In the late 1970s , Martin was the first to show that most of the behavioral effects of marijuana were attributable to the compound THC , and his contributions to the study of cannabinoid receptors in the brain brought new life to what was once thought to be a dead - end field . Billy was a groundbreaking researcher whose work changed the landscape of addiction research in this country , said Francis L . Macrina , Ph . D . , VCUs vice president for research . His advice also was sought worldwide by those who would set marijuana - control policy . In 1997 , Martin was awarded a National Institutes of Health Method to Extend Research in Time ( MERIT ) Award for his work in understanding the affect of marijuana on the brain . Martin also was asked by the National Institute of Drug Abuse to head an international program project grant on marijuana . Martin directed a team of prominent marijuana researchers from the United States and abroad in investigating anandamide , a naturally occurring marijuana - like substance in the brain . Martin served as director of VCUs NIDA Center for Drug Abuse Research , which attracted more than $20 million in federal funding . In 1998 , Martin was honored as a top contributor in science with a Virginia Top Scientist Award and received the VCU Distinguished Scholarship Award in 1996 . He also was the first recipient of the Outstanding Inventor Award from the VCU Tech Transfer Office in recognition of his multiple patents based on his research . Martin was to receive the Nathan B . Eddy Award on June 15 , the highest honor awarded by the College on Problems of Drug Dependence . He also was scheduled to receive the VCU Award for Excellence , the highest honor that this University bestows on a faculty member , this fall .", "tokens": ["Billy", "R", ".", "Martin", ",", "Ph", ".", "D", ".", ",", "chair", "of", "the", "Virginia", "Commonwealth", "University", "School", "of", "Medicines", "Department", "of", "Pharmacology", "and", "Toxicology", ",", "and", "internationally", "renowned", "for", "his", "research", "in", "understanding", "addiction", "and", "drugs", "of", "abuse", "and", "how", "they", "affect", "the", "brain", ",", "died", "Sunday", "in", "Richmond", ".", "He", "was", "65", ".", "Martin", "played", "a", "prominent", "role", "in", "developing", "the", "departments", "reputation", "for", "landmark", "research", "in", "drugs", "of", "abuse", ".", "For", "more", "than", "30", "years", ",", "Martins", "primary", "focus", "was", "researching", "the", "effects", "of", "marijuanas", "principal", "psychoactive", "ingredient", ",", "delta", "-", "9", "-", "tetrahydrocannabinol", ",", "or", "THC", ".", "In", "the", "late", "1970s", ",", "Martin", "was", "the", "first", "to", "show", "that", "most", "of", "the", "behavioral", "effects", "of", "marijuana", "were", "attributable", "to", "the", "compound", "THC", ",", "and", "his", "contributions", "to", "the", "study", "of", "cannabinoid", "receptors", "in", "the", "brain", "brought", "new", "life", "to", "what", "was", "once", "thought", "to", "be", "a", "dead", "-", "end", "field", ".", "Billy", "was", "a", "groundbreaking", "researcher", "whose", "work", "changed", "the", "landscape", "of", "addiction", "research", "in", "this", "country", ",", "said", "Francis", "L", ".", "Macrina", ",", "Ph", ".", "D", ".", ",", "VCUs", "vice", "president", "for", "research", ".", "His", "advice", "also", "was", "sought", "worldwide", "by", "those", "who", "would", "set", "marijuana", "-", "control", "policy", ".", "In", "1997", ",", "Martin", "was", "awarded", "a", "National", "Institutes", "of", "Health", "Method", "to", "Extend", "Research", "in", "Time", "(", "MERIT", ")", "Award", "for", "his", "work", "in", "understanding", "the", "affect", "of", "marijuana", "on", "the", "brain", ".", "Martin", "also", "was", "asked", "by", "the", "National", "Institute", "of", "Drug", "Abuse", "to", "head", "an", "international", "program", "project", "grant", "on", "marijuana", ".", "Martin", "directed", "a", "team", "of", "prominent", "marijuana", "researchers", "from", "the", "United", "States", "and", "abroad", "in", "investigating", "anandamide", ",", "a", "naturally", "occurring", "marijuana", "-", "like", "substance", "in", "the", "brain", ".", "Martin", "served", "as", "director", "of", "VCUs", "NIDA", "Center", "for", "Drug", "Abuse", "Research", ",", "which", "attracted", "more", "than", "$20", "million", "in", "federal", "funding", ".", "In", "1998", ",", "Martin", "was", "honored", "as", "a", "top", "contributor", "in", "science", "with", "a", "Virginia", "Top", "Scientist", "Award", "and", "received", "the", "VCU", "Distinguished", "Scholarship", "Award", "in", "1996", ".", "He", "also", "was", "the", "first", "recipient", "of", "the", "Outstanding", "Inventor", "Award", "from", "the", "VCU", "Tech", "Transfer", "Office", "in", "recognition", "of", "his", "multiple", "patents", "based", "on", "his", "research", ".", "Martin", "was", "to", "receive", "the", "Nathan", "B", ".", "Eddy", "Award", "on", "June", "15", ",", "the", "highest", "honor", "awarded", "by", "the", "College", "on", "Problems", "of", "Drug", "Dependence", ".", "He", "also", "was", "scheduled", "to", "receive", "the", "VCU", "Award", "for", "Excellence", ",", "the", "highest", "honor", "that", "this", "University", "bestows", "on", "a", "faculty", "member", ",", "this", "fall", "."], "record": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_0> highest education <extra_id_5> Ph .

Desrosiers serves as Director of Research Faculty Development and Professor in the Department of Pathology here at the Miller School of Medicine . Dr . Desrosiers was the leader of the team that discovered the simian immunodeficiency virus in 1984 and was senior author of its publication in Science in 1985 . Since that time , he has made numerous seminal contributions using the SIV / macaque model to better understand the mechanisms by which HIV - 1 and SIV cause disease and for vaccine development efforts . In 1990 , he described the first - ever infectious , pathogenic molecular clone of this group of viruses and to this day it remains the clone of choice for controlled experiments in monkeys . Its 10 , 279 base - pair sequence can be manipulated in any way such that the effects on viral tropism , replicative capacity , immune avoidance , and disease propensity can be examined . Dr . Desrosiers has used this system to better understand the relative importance and functional contribution of the so - called nonessential genes and to better understand the evolution of antigenic escape variants . He has shown that live attenuated SIV deletion mutants can serve effectively as vaccines . To this day , live attenuated SIV remains the gold standard for vaccine protection against SIV in monkeys to which all other vaccine approaches are compared . This work provides hope that a vaccine against HIV will be possible . While he has previously tried a number of novel vaccine concepts using the SIV / macaque model , he is currently focused on two approaches : use of AAV vector to deliver antibodies with potent , broad neutralizing activity and the use of recombinant persistent herpesviruses as vaccine vectors . He is the discoverer of the KSHV - related gamma - 2 herpesvirus of rhesus monkeys called rhesus monkey rhadinovirus that is being used for the latter efforts .

His first grant as a junior faculty member was the Young Investigator Award from the American Heart Association Oklahoma Affiliate in 1983 which started his work in developing techniques for recording accessory pathway activation potentials in patients with Wolff - Parkinson - White syndrome . He and his coworkers have played a significant role in the development of RF ablation by using novel recording techniques to localize the substrate for ablation of typical accessory pathways , epicardial posteroseptal accessory pathways , Mahaim fibers , slow AV nodal pathways ( multiple variants of AVNRT ) , Idiopathic LV Tachycardia ( Purkinje potentials ) and Post - MI VT ( mid diastolic potentials ) . In recognition of his research achievements Dr . Jackman was given the Provost ' s Research Award and the honorary title of George Lynn Cross Research Professor at the University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center in 1993 . In 1982 he won first prize in the Young Investigator Award Competition of the North American Society of Pacing and Electrophysiology based on the research he had done in his Fellowship . In 2000 he received the prestigious award of Pioneer in Pacing and Electrophysiology from the North American Society of Pacing and Electrophysiology , the youngest person so honored in the history of the society , for his work in the development of catheter ablation techniques . Jackman was recipient of the 2006 Mirowski Award . He has been cited in Best Doctors in America continuously since 1992 . Dr . Jackman has held active roles nationally in Heart Rhythm Society ( formerly the North American Society of Pacing and Electrophysiology ) . He became a Fellow of the Heart Rhythm Society in 2007 . He has been a prominent international educator . He was director of the course on Advanced Catheter Ablation of Cardiac Arrhythmias of the American College of Cardiology given at the Heart House in Bethesda , Maryland between 1993 and 1999 . He was Co - Director of an Advanced Course in Catheter Ablation of Cardiac Arrhythmias presented by HRI at the University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center in Oklahoma City since 1990 . He was also a Co - Director of a course on Minimally Invasive Surgical Ablation for Atrial Fibrillation taught at OUHSC since 2005 . He has lectured widely both nationally and internationally and has been an Investigator and Co - Investigator in grants from the American Heart Association , National Institutes of Health : National

She is Principal Investigator of the Seattle site of Health , Eating , Activity , and Lifestyle ( HEAL ) Study , which is assessing associations among anthropometrics , fat mass amount and distribution , endogenous sex and metabolic hormones , diet , and physical activity on prognostic factors in breast cancer patients . Dr . McTiernan is Principal Investigator of the Seattle site of the ExCel trial which is testing the effect of exemestane , an aromatase inhibitor , on breast cancer prevention , and she leads a randomized clinical trial testing aspirin effect on breast cancer biomarkers . Previously she has conducted a randomized controlled clinical trial of a one - year aerobic exercise intervention vs . stretch control in 173 postmenopausal women . The primary aim of this study was to assess the effect of exercise on endogenous sex hormones that have been associated with increased risk for breast cancer . Ongoing ancillary studies test the effect of aerobic exercise on immune function and other biomarkers of breast cancer risk . She is also been Principal Investigator of a randomized clinical trial to test the effect of a one - year aerobic exercise intervention vs . control on colorectal cell proliferation , apoptosis , and prostaglandin content , and on other biomarkers of colon cancer risk in 200 men and women with adenomatous colon polyps . Dr . McTiernan was a co - Investigator in the Women ' s Health Initiative ( WHI ) , and directed clinical outcomes efforts at the WHI Clinical Coordinating Center . She has conducted an analysis of physical activity and breast cancer incidence in the WHI Observational Study cohort of over 90 , 000 women and has collaborated on many additional analyses .",

{"text": "I was born in Belgium in 1955 . As an undergraduate , I attended the Universit Catholique de Louvain and got a Licence in Law in 1978 and a Licence in economics in 1980 . After my military service , I spent nearly five years working for the International Labour Organization , a United Nations agency overlooking issues of employment , income distribution , and vocational training . My responsability was rural development . I was based in Addis Ababa , Ethiopia , but I had to travel to all parts of Africa . From 1981 to 1985 I must have visited more than 20 of the 50 or so African states . I met my wife in Ethiopia and we got married in Nairobi in 1983 . Because I had developed a stong interest in research during my years in Africa , I went back to graduate school in 1986 . In August 1989 I completed a Ph . D . in Agricultural Economics from the University of California at Berkeley for which I won an Outstanding Ph . D . Thesis Award from the American Agricultural Economists Association . In the process of getting my degree I also spent 8 months in Hyderabad , India . During my stay I travelled throughout India and had an opportunity to compare the way people live there with what I had seen in Africa . Except for a quarter teaching at the University of Chicago in 1995 , I spent the period between September 1989 and the Summer of 1996 teaching at the Food Research Institute at Stanford . Following the closure of the Institute , I moved to the Department of Economics at Stanford where I taught for two years . I spent the 1998 - 99 academic year on sabbatical leave in the Research Department of the World Bank . I taught in the Department of Economics of Oxford University between July 1999 and October 2013 , except for a sabbatical year spent in the department of economics at Harvard ( 2005 - 6 ) and half a year of sabbatical in the Department of Economics at Stanford ( 2012 ) .

{"text": "Dr . Kohn received an A . B . degree from Harvard in 1952 with majors in Chemistry and Physics , an M . D . degree from Columbia College of Physicians and Surgeons in 1956 , and a Ph . D . in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology from Harvard in 1965 . After internship at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York , Kohn came to the National Cancer Institute and served as Clinical Associate in the Clinical Pharmacology Service ( headed by Paul Condit ) 1957 - 1960 . He then spent 2 years as a graduate student and post - doctoral fellow in Paul Doty ' s laboratory at Harvard , returning to the NCI in 1962 as a member of the Laboratory of Chemical Pharmacology headed by David P . Rall ( this Laboratory was a transformation of the earlier Clinical Pharmacology Service ) . In 1968 , Kohn founded the Laboratory of Molecular Pharmacology ( LMP ) and served as its Chief until 1997 . During this time ( 1961 - 1997 ) , Kohn ' s major area of investigation concerned the mechanisms of action of DNA - targeted anticancer drugs . He demonstrated that bifunctional alkylating agents produce DNA interstrand crosslinks and that this is their major cytotoxic action . He elucidated a new mechanism of drug action on DNA , based on the anthramycin group of antibiotics . In 1974 , he discovered the DNA filter elution phenomenon in which DNA molecules pass through micropore filters at a rate dependent on DNA strand length . Based on these observations , he developed methodology to measure several types of DNA damage in mammalian cells . This methodology was widely used for more than 20 years in many laboratories to study DNA damage and repair in mammalian cells . By DNA filter elution studies , Kohn and his colleagues in 1979 - 1982 showed that DNA topoisomerases are targets of action of several clinical anticancer drugs . This led to worldwide interest in topoisomerase - targeted drugs that has continued to the present time . In the 1990 ' s , Kohn and his colleagues began to apply the emerging knowledge of cell cycle checkpoints to study the responses of cancer cells to DNA damage . As an aid to this end , Kohn developed a notation for molecular interaction maps that has recently received considerable interest . Since 1997 , Kohn has continued as a Principle Investigator in the LMP , focusing on molecular interaction mapping and computer simulation of bioregulatory networks relevant to cancer and therapeutics . In addition , he continues to collaborate and consult on various LMP projects and with other laboratories .", "tokens": ["Dr", ".", "Kohn", "received", "an", "A", ".", "B", ".", "degree", "from", "Harvard", "in", "1952", "with", "majors", "in", "Chemistry", "and", "Physics", ",", "an", "M", ".", "D", ".", "degree", "from", "Columbia", "College", "of", "Physicians", "and", "Surgeons", "in", "1956", ",", "and", "a", "Ph", ".", "D", ".", "in", "Biochemistry", "and", "Molecular", "Biology", "from", "Harvard", "in", "1965", ".", "After", "internship", "at", "Mount", "Sinai", "Hospital", "in", "New", "York", ",", "Kohn", "came", "to", "the", "National", "Cancer", "Institute", "and", "served", "as", "Clinical", "Associate", "in", "the", "Clinical", "Pharmacology", "Service", "(", "headed", "by", "Paul", "Condit", ")", "1957", "-", "1960", ".", "He", "then", "spent", "2", "years", "as", "a", "graduate", "student", "and", "post", "-", "doctoral", "fellow", "in", "Paul", "Doty", "'", "s", "laboratory", "at", "Harvard", ",", "returning", "to", "the", "NCI", "in", "1962", "as", "a", "member", "of", "the", "Laboratory", "of", "Chemical", "Pharmacology", "headed", "by", "David", "P", ".", "Rall", "(", "this", "Laboratory", "was", "a", "transformation", "of", "the", "earlier", "Clinical", "Pharmacology", "Service", ")", ".", "In", "1968", ",", "Kohn", "founded", "the", "Laboratory", "of", "Molecular", "Pharmacology", "(", "LMP", ")", "and", "served", "as", "its", "Chief", "until", "1997", ".", "During", "this", "time", "(", "1961", "-", "1997", ")", ",", "Kohn", "'", "s", "major", "area", "of", "investigation", "concerned", "the", "mechanisms", "of", "action", "of", "DNA", "-", "targeted", "anticancer", "drugs", ".", "He", "demonstrated", "that", "bifunctional", "alkylating", "agents", "produce", "DNA", "interstrand", "crosslinks", "and", "that", "this", "is", "their", "major", "cytotoxic", "action", ".", "He", "elucidated", "a", "new", "mechanism", "of", "drug", "action", "on", "DNA", ",", "based", "on", "the", "anthramycin", "group", "of", "antibiotics", ".", "In", "1974", ",", "he", "discovered", "the", "DNA", "filter", "elution", "phenomenon", "in", "which", "DNA", "molecules", "pass", "through", "micropore", "filters", "at", "a", "rate", "dependent", "on", "DNA", "strand", "length", ".", "Based", "on", "these", "observations", ",", "he", "developed", "methodology", "to", "measure", "several", "types", "of", "DNA", "damage", "in", "mammalian", "cells", ".", "This", "methodology", "was", "widely", "used", "for", "more", "than", "20", "years", "in", "many", "laboratories", "to", "study", "DNA", "damage", "and", "repair", "in", "mammalian", "cells", ".", "By", "DNA", "filter", "elution", "studies", ",", "Kohn", "and", "his", "colleagues", "in", "1979", "-", "1982", "showed", "that", "DNA", "topoisomerases", "are", "targets", "of", "action", "of", "several", "clinical", "anticancer", "drugs", ".", "This", "led", "to", "worldwide", "interest", "in", "topoisomerase", "-", "targeted", "drugs", "that", "has", "continued", "to", "the", "present", "time", ".", "In", "the", "1990", "'", "s", ",", "Kohn", "and", "his", "colleagues", "began", "to", "apply", "the", "emerging", "knowledge", "of", "cell", "cycle", "checkpoints", "to", "study", "the", "responses", "of", "cancer", "cells", "to", "DNA", "damage", ".", "As", "an", "aid", "to", "this", "end", ",", "Kohn", "developed", "a", "notation", "for", "molecular", "interaction", "maps", "that", "has", "recently", "received", "considerable", "interest", ".", "Since", "1997", ",", "Kohn", "has", "continued", "as", "a", "Principle", "Investigator", "in", "the", "LMP", ",", "focusing", "on", "molecular", "interaction", "mapping", "and", "computer", "simulation", "of", "bioregulatory", "networks", "relevant", "to", "cancer", "and", "therapeutics", ".", "In", "addition", ",", "he", "continues", "to", "collaborate", "and", "consult", "on", "various", "LMP", "projects", "and", "with", "other", "laboratories", "."], "record": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_0> education <extra_id_5> Dr .

She joined the faculty in 1971 and served as Vice - Chair for Research at the Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology from 1997 to 1999 . She has also served as Associate Dean of the Indiana University Graduate School and Director of the Graduate Office , Indiana University Purdue University Indianapolis ( IUPUI ) , since 1999 . Sherry Queener received her B . S . with Honors from Oklahoma Baptist University in Shawnee , Oklahoma , and her M . S . in Biochemistry from the University of Illinois at Urbana - Champaign , where she also received her Ph . D . in Biochemistry . Dr . Queeners primary research interest is the interaction of drugs with their targets in pathogenic microorganisms . Currently , this interest is focused on exploiting drug targets in opportunistic pathogens such as Pneumocystis carinii , Toxoplasma gondii , and Mycobacterium avium . The targets that she and her colleagues have explored include such well - known drug targets as the folate pathway enzymes that are sensitive to drugs such as pyrimethamine or sulfonamides . Her laboratory has also suggested that an enzyme in purine biosynthesis may be a uniquely sensitive target for chemotherapy in P . carinii . She and her colleagues are also seeking to identify the molecular target of 8 - aminoquinolines in sensitive organisms such as P . carinii , which would clarify the mechanism of action of these long - used but little - understood drugs . At IUPUI Dr . Queeners primary teaching responsibilities are with medical students and graduate students involved in research careers , but she has taught allied health and nursing students in various formats since joining the faculty in 1971 .

{"text": "Eckard Wimmer ( born 22 May 1936 ) is a German American virologist , organic chemist and distinguished professor of molecular genetics and microbiology at Stony Brook University . He is best known for his seminal work on the molecular biology of poliovirus and the first chemical synthesis of a viral genome capable of infection and subsequent production of live viruses . Eckard Albert Friedrich Wimmer was born on May 22 , 1936 in Berlin , Germany . At the onset of World War II , Wimmer at age three lost his father ; at age nine , his mother fled together with his two older brothers to Saxony , East Germany , where he finished elementary school and high school . He studied Chemistry at the University of Rostock from 1953 to 1956 , and then fled to West Germany to continue his Chemistry studies at University of Gttingen . In 1962 he earned the degree of Doctor rerum naturalium ( Dr . rer . nat . ) in the Organic Chemistry of natural products under the guidance of Hans Brockmann . Wimmer worked at the University of Gttingen as a research associate and instructor until 1964 . Intrigued by the chemistry of living cells , however , he shifted his research interests in 1964 and joined Gordon Tener at the Department of Biochemistry of the University of British Columbia in Vancouver , Canada , to study transfer RNA . Then in 1966 he worked with Manfred E . Reichmann in the Department of Botany at the University of Illinois to study plant viruses . In 1968 , during a five - months visit in David Baltimores laboratory at MIT , Wimmer was introduced to poliovirus , the infectious agent of his choice until today . Between 1968 and 1974 he taught and conducted research in the Department of Microbiology in the Saint Louis University School of Medicine in Missouri . He and his family moved to Stony Brook University on Long Island , NY , in 1974 to join the Department of Microbiology , School of Medicine , an academic environment in which he is still actively engaged today . In 1979 he was promoted to professor at Stony Brook University and from 1984 to 1999 he served as the Chairman of the Department . Wimmer was honored as a Distinguished Professor of the State University of New York at Stony Brook in 2002 Wimmer is married since 1965 to Astrid ne Brose , a German physical therapist , who earned her Ph .

D . degrees from Brown University , trained in Pediatrics at Yale , was then a postdoctoral fellow first at Salk Institute in the Tumor Virology Laboratory , and then in Genetics at Yale , then joined the Yale faculty . His work was initially involved with protein import into mitochondria and resulted in discovery of a \" folding machine \" inside mitochondria , Hsp60 . He has used genetic , biochemical , and biophysical tools to study the mechanism of action of these ring shaped so - called chaperonin machines that provide essential assistance to protein folding in many cellular compartments . More recently he has focused on neurodegenerative disease as caused by protein misfolding , seeking to understand how misfolded SOD1 enzyme in the cytosol of motor neurons leads to one form of ALS . His lab is modeling mutant SOD1 - linked ALS in mice transgenic for a mutant SOD1 - YFP , the YFP moiety offering a fluorescent reporter of the mutant protein and tag for biochemical studies . The transgenic mutant strain presents YFP fluorescent aggregates in motor neurons by the time of weaning , develops muscle weakness , and paralyzes by 6 months of age . By contrast , a wtSOD1 - YFP transgenic strain with the same amount of total SOD1 - YFP protein in spinal cord remains asymptomatic even after two years , and the cord remains free of aggregates . The nature of injury to the motor system of the mutant mice is under study , particularly at the level of lower motor neurons , examining their dendritic arbors , cell bodies , axons , and neuromuscular junctions , using both morphologic and electrophysiologic approaches . What is the most immediate target of the misfolded protein , and at what level in the motor system ? Notably , endogenous molecular chaperones , Hsc70 and Hsp110 , associate with the misfolded protein they are obviously not able to fully protect the system . Can their overexpression alter the progression of motor dysfunction ?

{"text": "Biochemist Alton Meisters research on amino acid metabolism and the synthesis of peptide bonds contributed to our understanding of the human immune system . His early studies dealt primarily with the enzymatic decarboxylation of aspartic acid and glutamic acid . He proposed a new mechanism for the biosynthesis of glutamine involving a specific carboxylic acid intermediate , and from it was able to determine the mechanism of action of the methionine sulfoxime enzyme involved in the process . His other significant findings included the crystallization of L - amino acid oxidase , the development of a gas - liquid chromatography method for the determination of amino acids , and most importantly , his extensive research on the amino acid compound glutathione . Meister discovered that glutathione ( a compound containing the amino acids cysteine , glycine , and glutamic acid ) prevented cells from oxidizing by bonding the cysteines thiol ( S - H ) group with the incoming oxygen atoms . When he noticed that individuals infected with the AIDS virus had lower levels of glutathione , he incorporated the amino acid compound into a drug to treat the virus . Although this wasnt an absolute cure for the AIDS virus , it established a more complete understanding of the immune system that laid the foundation for the treatment of AIDS . Meister graduated from Harvard University with a B . S . degree in 1942 and received his medical degree from Cornell University Medical College three years later . He served as chairman of the colleges biochemistry department for almost 35 years . In 1947 , he became a research investigator at the National Institutes of Health in Maryland . After eight years , he was appointed the head of the Clinical Biomedical Research Section of the Laboratory of Biochemistry for the institutions National Cancer Institute . Meister ended his research career in 1955 to become a professor and chairman of the biochemistry department at Tufts University School of Medicine . In 1967 , he accepted the same position at his alma mater . He then became the biochemist - in - chief for the New York Hospital at the Cornell Medical Center in 1971 , and he remained there until his retirement . He was a member of the American Society of Biological Chemists ( he served as president from 1977 to 1978 ) , the American Chemical Society ( ACS ) , the Society for Experimental Biology and Medicine , and several other scientific organizations . For his innovative research in biochemistry , Meister was the recipient of the Paul Lewis Award in Enzyme Chemistry from ACS in 1954 , the Founders Award from the Chemical Industry Institute of Toxicology in 1985 , and ( among many others ) the Merit Award from the National Institutes of Health in 1987 .", "tokens": ["Biochemist", "Alton", "Meisters", "research", "on", "amino", "acid", "metabolism", "and", "the", "synthesis", "of", "peptide", "bonds", "contributed", "to", "our", "understanding", "of", "the", "human", "immune", "system", ".", "His", "early", "studies", "dealt", "primarily", "with", "the", "enzymatic", "decarboxylation", "of", "aspartic", "acid", "and", "glutamic", "acid", ".", "He", "proposed", "a", "new", "mechanism", "for", "the", "biosynthesis", "of", "glutamine", "involving", "a", "specific", "carboxylic", "acid", "intermediate", ",", "and", "from", "it", "was", "able", "to", "determine", "the", "mechanism", "of", "action", "of", "the", "methionine", "sulfoxime", "enzyme", "involved", "in", "the", "process", ".", "His", "other", "significant", "findings", "included", "the", "crystallization", "of", "L", "-", "amino", "acid", "oxidase", ",", "the", "development", "of", "a", "gas", "-", "liquid", "chromatography", "method", "for", "the", "determination", "of", "amino", "acids", ",", "and", "most", "importantly", ",", "his", "extensive", "research", "on", "the", "amino", "acid", "compound", "glutathione", ".", "Meister", "discovered", "that", "glutathione", "(", "a", "compound", "containing", "the", "amino", "acids", "cysteine", ",", "glycine", ",", "and", "glutamic", "acid", ")", "prevented", "cells", "from", "oxidizing", "by", "bonding", "the", "cysteines", "thiol", "(", "S", "-", "H", ")", "group", "with", "the", "incoming", "oxygen", "atoms", ".", "When", "he", "noticed", "that", "individuals", "infected", "with", "the", "AIDS", "virus", "had", "lower", "levels", "of", "glutathione", ",", "he", "incorporated", "the", "amino", "acid", "compound", "into", "a", "drug", "to", "treat", "the", "virus", ".", "Although", "this", "wasnt", "an", "absolute", "cure", "for", "the", "AIDS", "virus", ",", "it", "established", "a", "more", "complete", "understanding", "of", "the", "immune", "system", "that", "laid", "the", "foundation", "for", "the", "treatment", "of", "AIDS", ".", "Meister", "graduated", "from", "Harvard", "University", "with", "a", "B", ".", "S", ".", "degree", "in", "1942", "and", "received", "his", "medical", "degree", "from", "Cornell", "University", "Medical", "College", "three", "years", "later", ".", "He", "served", "as", "chairman", "of", "the", "colleges", "biochemistry", "department", "for", "almost", "35", "years", ".", "In", "1947", ",", "he", "became", "a", "research", "investigator", "at", "the", "National", "Institutes", "of", "Health", "in", "Maryland", ".", "After", "eight", "years", ",", "he", "was", "appointed", "the", "head", "of", "the", "Clinical", "Biomedical", "Research", "Section", "of", "the", "Laboratory", "of", "Biochemistry", "for", "the", "institutions", "National", "Cancer", "Institute", ".", "Meister", "ended", "his", "research", "career", "in", "1955", "to", "become", "a", "professor", "and", "chairman", "of", "the", "biochemistry", "department", "at", "Tufts", "University", "School", "of", "Medicine", ".", "In", "1967", ",", "he", "accepted", "the", "same", "position", "at", "his", "alma", "mater", ".", "He", "then", "became", "the", "biochemist", "-", "in", "-", "chief", "for", "the", "New", "York", "Hospital", "at", "the", "Cornell", "Medical", "Center", "in", "1971", ",", "and", "he", "remained", "there", "until", "his", "retirement", ".", "He", "was", "a", "member", "of", "the", "American", "Society", "of", "Biological", "Chemists", "(", "he", "served", "as", "president", "from", "1977", "to", "1978", ")", ",", "the", "American", "Chemical", "Society", "(", "ACS", ")", ",", "the", "Society", "for", "Experimental", "Biology", "and", "Medicine", ",", "and", "several", "other", "scientific", "organizations", ".", "For", "his", "innovative", "research", "in", "biochemistry", ",", "Meister", "was", "the", "recipient", "of", "the", "Paul", "Lewis", "Award", "in", "Enzyme", "Chemistry", "from", "ACS", "in", "1954", ",", "the", "Founders", "Award", "from", "the", "Chemical", "Industry", "Institute", "of", "Toxicology", "in", "1985", ",", "and", "(", "among", "many", "others", ")", "the", "Merit", "Award", "from", "the", "National", "Institutes", "of", "Health", "in", "1987", "."], "record": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_0> research interests <extra_id_5> amino acid metabolism and the synthesis of peptide <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> gender <extra_id_5> He <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> education <extra_id_5> Meister graduated from Harvard University with a B .

{"text": "William Morton Wheeler , Ph . D . ( March 19 , 1865 April 19 , 1937 ) was an American entomologist , myrmecologist and Harvard professor . Born as the son of Julius Morton and Caroline Georgiana Wheeler ( ne Anderson ) in Milwaukee , he was transferred from public school to a local German academy due to , in his own words , \" persistently bad behavior \" . They had a small museum which Wheeler had studied since he was a child , and when Ward ' s Natural Science Establishment in early 1884 brought a collection of stuffed and skeletonized animals to the academy , to persuade the city fathers to purchase them , Wheeler volunteered to spend the nights in helping Ward to unpack and install the specimens . The latter was so impressed that he offered Wheeler a job in his Rochester , New York establishment . Here he identified birds and mammals , and later collections of shells , echinoderms and sponges . His shell catalogue was still in use by collectors in the late 1920s . Wheeler was trained as an insect embryologist , having studied under Baur , Dohrn and Whitman , but he became the leading authority on the behaviour of social insects , achieving particular renown for his studies of social behaviour of ants . He was instrumental in the development of ethology and first popularized the term in a 1902 paper in Science . As a taxonomist , Wheeler was responsible for the descriptions of innumerable species , Pogonomyrmex maricopa , the most venomous insect in the world , being among them . Professor Wheeler was curator of invertebrate zoology in the American Museum of Natural History in New York from 1903 to 1908 . He was elected to the National Academy of Sciences . A close contact of the British myrmecologist and coleopterist Horace Donisthorpe , it was to Wheeler whom Donisthorpe dedicated his first major book on ants in 1915 . Donisthorpe and Wheeler also frequently exchanged specimens , leading the latter to first develop the idea that the Formicinae subfamily had its origins in North America . For his work , Ants of the American Museum Congo Expedition , Wheeler was awarded the Daniel Giraud Elliot Medal from the National Academy of Sciences in 1922 . He was professor of applied biology at Harvard University ' s Bussey Institute , which had one of the most highly regarded biology programs in the United States . One of his pupils there was Alfred Kinsey .", "tokens": ["William", "Morton", "Wheeler", ",", "Ph", ".", "D", ".", "(", "March", "19", ",", "1865", "April", "19", ",", "1937", ")", "was", "an", "American", "entomologist", ",", "myrmecologist", "and", "Harvard", "professor", ".", "Born", "as", "the", "son", "of", "Julius", "Morton", "and", "Caroline", "Georgiana", "Wheeler", "(", "ne", "Anderson", ")", "in", "Milwaukee", ",", "he", "was", "transferred", "from", "public", "school", "to", "a", "local", "German", "academy", "due", "to", ",", "in", "his", "own", "words", ",", "\"", "persistently", "bad", "behavior", "\"", ".", "They", "had", "a", "small", "museum", "which", "Wheeler", "had", "studied", "since", "he", "was", "a", "child", ",", "and", "when", "Ward", "'", "s", "Natural", "Science", "Establishment", "in", "early", "1884", "brought", "a", "collection", "of", "stuffed", "and", "skeletonized", "animals", "to", "the", "academy", ",", "to", "persuade", "the", "city", "fathers", "to", "purchase", "them", ",", "Wheeler", "volunteered", "to", "spend", "the", "nights", "in", "helping", "Ward", "to", "unpack", "and", "install", "the", "specimens", ".", "The", "latter", "was", "so", "impressed", "that", "he", "offered", "Wheeler", "a", "job", "in", "his", "Rochester", ",", "New", "York", "establishment", ".", "Here", "he", "identified", "birds", "and", "mammals", ",", "and", "later", "collections", "of", "shells", ",", "echinoderms", "and", "sponges", ".", "His", "shell", "catalogue", "was", "still", "in", "use", "by", "collectors", "in", "the", "late", "1920s", ".", "Wheeler", "was", "trained", "as", "an", "insect", "embryologist", ",", "having", "studied", "under", "Baur", ",", "Dohrn", "and", "Whitman", ",", "but", "he", "became", "the", "leading", "authority", "on", "the", "behaviour", "of", "social", "insects", ",", "achieving", "particular", "renown", "for", "his", "studies", "of", "social", "behaviour", "of", "ants", ".", "He", "was", "instrumental", "in", "the", "development", "of", "ethology", "and", "first", "popularized", "the", "term", "in", "a", "1902", "paper", "in", "Science", ".", "As", "a", "taxonomist", ",", "Wheeler", "was", "responsible", "for", "the", "descriptions", "of", "innumerable", "species", ",", "Pogonomyrmex", "maricopa", ",", "the", "most", "venomous", "insect", "in", "the", "world", ",", "being", "among", "them", ".", "Professor", "Wheeler", "was", "curator", "of", "invertebrate", "zoology", "in", "the", "American", "Museum", "of", "Natural", "History", "in", "New", "York", "from", "1903", "to", "1908", ".", "He", "was", "elected", "to", "the", "National", "Academy", "of", "Sciences", ".", "A", "close", "contact", "of", "the", "British", "myrmecologist", "and", "coleopterist", "Horace", "Donisthorpe", ",", "it", "was", "to", "Wheeler", "whom", "Donisthorpe", "dedicated", "his", "first", "major", "book", "on", "ants", "in", "1915", ".", "Donisthorpe", "and", "Wheeler", "also", "frequently", "exchanged", "specimens", ",", "leading", "the", "latter", "to", "first", "develop", "the", "idea", "that", "the", "Formicinae", "subfamily", "had", "its", "origins", "in", "North", "America", ".", "For", "his", "work", ",", "Ants", "of", "the", "American", "Museum", "Congo", "Expedition", ",", "Wheeler", "was", "awarded", "the", "Daniel", "Giraud", "Elliot", "Medal", "from", "the", "National", "Academy", "of", "Sciences", "in", "1922", ".", "He", "was", "professor", "of", "applied", "biology", "at", "Harvard", "University", "'", "s", "Bussey", "Institute", ",", "which", "had", "one", "of", "the", "most", "highly", "regarded", "biology", "programs", "in", "the", "United", "States", ".", "One", "of", "his", "pupils", "there", "was", "Alfred", "Kinsey", "."], "record": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_0> highest education <extra_id_5> Ph .

{"text": "e are deeply saddened by the death of Franco Benazzi , MD , DTMH , PhD , which occurred on August 22 , 2009 . Franco was a unique individual , committed to clinical care and to his wishes to share his ideas about bipolar disorder . Franco was extremely devoted to his patients , most of whom suffered from bipolar disorder . What made Francos scientific publications unique was that although he was a solo private practitioner in a small Italian community and did not have a full - time academic appointment , he still had as much impact as his colleagues from prestigious universities with large funding sources . Having no external funding , Franco had no protected time to conduct research . He had no need to publish to be promoted or to secure fundingonly his wishes to communicate his ideas and benefit the field . Francos contributions were made possible by his systematically collected clinical observations of his own patients . He was mostly a solo researcher who single - handedly collected data , conducted statistical analyses , and wrote manuscripts without the support of a research staff . He was also a valuable collaborator who respected others points of view , and even if he disagreed with a particular point , he was always willing to add value . The October and November issues of the Journal include 2 examples of Francos thoughtful publications ; one leading a group of collaborators from different institutions including myself ( JCP 2009 ; 70 [ 10 ] : 14241431 ) and the second as a single author ( see pp 15141521 ) . Franco was a productive writer with over 300 publications , and he was an ISI Science Watch most - cited author in 2003 . Among his major contributions to the bipolar disorder field were his ideas about and publications on the course and treatment of mixed bipolar depression . I had the privilege of collaborating with him in this area and feel very grateful for what he taught me . His observations were especially valued as they came from an experienced clinician working in an ordinary outpatient private - practice clinical setting . The son of a farmer , Franco came from humble beginnings and worked at various odd jobs before graduating from medical school . He was also a committed husband , and he had a fascination for European sports cars , especially BMWs . Franco will be greatly missed for his scientific contributions , but also , most importantly , for his warmth , good humor , and friendship .", "tokens": ["e", "are", "deeply", "saddened", "by", "the", "death", "of", "Franco", "Benazzi", ",", "MD", ",", "DTMH", ",", "PhD", ",", "which", "occurred", "on", "August", "22", ",", "2009", ".", "Franco", "was", "a", "unique", "individual", ",", "committed", "to", "clinical", "care", "and", "to", "his", "wishes", "to", "share", "his", "ideas", "about", "bipolar", "disorder", ".", "Franco", "was", "extremely", "devoted", "to", "his", "patients", ",", "most", "of", "whom", "suffered", "from", "bipolar", "disorder", ".", "What", "made", "Francos", "scientific", "publications", "unique", "was", "that", "although", "he", "was", "a", "solo", "private", "practitioner", "in", "a", "small", "Italian", "community", "and", "did", "not", "have", "a", "full", "-", "time", "academic", "appointment", ",", "he", "still", "had", "as", "much", "impact", "as", "his", "colleagues", "from", "prestigious", "universities", "with", "large", "funding", "sources", ".", "Having", "no", "external", "funding", ",", "Franco", "had", "no", "protected", "time", "to", "conduct", "research", ".", "He", "had", "no", "need", "to", "publish", "to", "be", "promoted", "or", "to", "secure", "fundingonly", "his", "wishes", "to", "communicate", "his", "ideas", "and", "benefit", "the", "field", ".", "Francos", "contributions", "were", "made", "possible", "by", "his", "systematically", "collected", "clinical", "observations", "of", "his", "own", "patients", ".", "He", "was", "mostly", "a", "solo", "researcher", "who", "single", "-", "handedly", "collected", "data", ",", "conducted", "statistical", "analyses", ",", "and", "wrote", "manuscripts", "without", "the", "support", "of", "a", "research", "staff", ".", "He", "was", "also", "a", "valuable", "collaborator", "who", "respected", "others", "points", "of", "view", ",", "and", "even", "if", "he", "disagreed", "with", "a", "particular", "point", ",", "he", "was", "always", "willing", "to", "add", "value", ".", "The", "October", "and", "November", "issues", "of", "the", "Journal", "include", "2", "examples", "of", "Francos", "thoughtful", "publications", ";", "one", "leading", "a", "group", "of", "collaborators", "from", "different", "institutions", "including", "myself", "(", "JCP", "2009", ";", "70", "[", "10", "]", ":", "14241431", ")", "and", "the", "second", "as", "a", "single", "author", "(", "see", "pp", "15141521", ")", ".", "Franco", "was", "a", "productive", "writer", "with", "over", "300", "publications", ",", "and", "he", "was", "an", "ISI", "Science", "Watch", "most", "-", "cited", "author", "in", "2003", ".", "Among", "his", "major", "contributions", "to", "the", "bipolar", "disorder", "field", "were", "his", "ideas", "about", "and", "publications", "on", "the", "course", "and", "treatment", "of", "mixed", "bipolar", "depression", ".", "I", "had", "the", "privilege", "of", "collaborating", "with", "him", "in", "this", "area", "and", "feel", "very", "grateful", "for", "what", "he", "taught", "me", ".", "His", "observations", "were", "especially", "valued", "as", "they", "came", "from", "an", "experienced", "clinician", "working", "in", "an", "ordinary", "outpatient", "private", "-", "practice", "clinical", "setting", ".", "The", "son", "of", "a", "farmer", ",", "Franco", "came", "from", "humble", "beginnings", "and", "worked", "at", "various", "odd", "jobs", "before", "graduating", "from", "medical", "school", ".", "He", "was", "also", "a", "committed", "husband", ",", "and", "he", "had", "a", "fascination", "for", "European", "sports", "cars", ",", "especially", "BMWs", ".", "Franco", "will", "be", "greatly", "missed", "for", "his", "scientific", "contributions", ",", "but", "also", ",", "most", "importantly", ",", "for", "his", "warmth", ",", "good", "humor", ",", "and", "friendship", "."], "record": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_0> highest education <extra_id_5> PhD <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> gender <extra_id_5> his <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> research interests <extra_id_5> on the course and treatment of mixed bipolar depression <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1>", "entity": [{"type": "gender", "offset": [37], "text": "his"}, {"type": "highest education", "offset": [15], "text": "PhD"}, {"type": "research interests", "offset": [314, 315, 316, 317, 318, 319, 320, 321, 322], "text": "on the course and treatment of mixed bipolar depression"}], "relation": [], "event": [], "spot": ["gender", "research interests", "highest education"], "asoc": [], "spot_asoc": [{"span": "PhD", "label": "highest education", "asoc": []}, {"span": "his", "label": "gender", "asoc": []}, {"span": "on the course and treatment of mixed bipolar depression", "label": "research interests", "asoc": []}]}

Wang ' s working areas include machine learning , data mining and computational intelligence systems for Bioinformatics and Engineering Applications . Technically , his research focus falls in subtle pattern discovery and recognition using neural networks and fuzzy systems , and in recent years he has been working towards to the development of randomized methods for neural networks , specifically , contributing to develop a brand new framework for building randomized learner models , termed as Stochatic Configuration Networks ( SCNs ) . In contrast to the existing randomised learning algorithms for single layer feed - forward neural networks , we randomly assign the input weights and biases of the hidden nodes in the light of a supervisory mechanism , and the output weights are analytically evaluated in either constructive or selective manner . As fundamentals of SCN - based data modelling techniques , we establish some theoretical results on the universal approximation property . Some experimental results indicate that our proposed SCNs outperform than other randomized neural networks in terms of less human intervention on the network size setting , the scope adaptation of random parameters , fast learning and sound generalization . Deep sctochastic configuration networks ( DeepSCNs ) have been developed and mathematically proved as universal approximators for continous nonlinear functions defined over compact sets . DeepSCNs can be constructed efficiently ( much faster than other deep neural networks ) and share many great features , such as learning representation and consistency property between learning and generalization . Details about SCNs and DeepSCNs could be found in our relevant publications at this homepage or ResearchGate .", "tokens": ["Dr", "Wang", "received", "his", "PhD", "degree", "in", "March", "1995",

{"text": "I am a particle physicist working on the ATLAS experiment ( http : / / atlas . ch / ) . I am particularly interested in searches for new heavy particles . We haven ' t seen any of these in the recently completed Large Hadron Collider ( LHC ) run , however a new run at an increased energy is planned for 2015 and I am very excited to be searching for such beasts again . In case such objects are out of the direct LHC reach I will be searching for their subtle traces using advanced statistical methods as I have done in the existing ATLAS dataset . I am also passionate about development of electronics hardware and high volume real - time data processing . Over last few years I have been developing firmware for one of the trigger upgrade components - the CMX board . The module processes approximately 10 GB of data every second with tiny ( ~100ns ) latencies . The trigger system selects in real time a tiny interesting fraction from the bulk of proton - proton collisions for storage . The first level ( \" Level 1 \" ) of this processing is accomplished in dedicated electronics hardware . The CMX will fit within the Level 1 system and count objects such as electrons , jets , tau leptons . It will also forward full object information over 24 multi - gigabit optical links for further topological processing . Previously I helped to commission ATLAS High Level Trigger ( HLT ) . The HLT processes the data that have been selected by the Level 1 system and selects a fraction of these collisions for final storage . I have taken numerous leadership roles . In the context of the trigger upgrade project I have been co - coordinating the commissioning efforts for the CMX board and coordinating the work of three other firmware developers . I led large teams of researchers during the early searches for the high mass particles and later coordinated the work of 10 analysis teams . I chaired and sat on several internal publication review committees . I supervised graduate and undergraduate students .", "tokens": ["I", "am", "a", "particle", "physicist", "working", "on", "the", "ATLAS", "experiment", "(", "http", ":", "/", "/", "atlas", ".", "ch", "/", ")", ".", "I", "am", "particularly", "interested", "in", "searches", "for", "new", "heavy", "particles", ".", "We", "haven", "'", "t", "seen", "any", "of", "these", "in", "the", "recently", "completed", "Large", "Hadron", "Collider", "(", "LHC", ")", "run", ",", "however", "a", "new", "run", "at", "an", "increased", "energy", "is", "planned", "for", "2015", "and", "I", "am", "very", "excited", "to", "be", "searching", "for", "such", "beasts", "again", ".", "In", "case", "such", "objects", "are", "out", "of", "the", "direct", "LHC", "reach", "I", "will", "be", "searching", "for", "their", "subtle", "traces", "using", "advanced", "statistical", "methods", "as", "I", "have", "done", "in", "the", "existing", "ATLAS", "dataset", ".", "I", "am", "also", "passionate", "about", "development", "of", "electronics", "hardware", "and", "high", "volume", "real", "-", "time", "data", "processing", ".", "Over", "last", "few", "years", "I", "have", "been", "developing", "firmware", "for", "one", "of", "the", "trigger", "upgrade", "components", "-", "the", "CMX", "board", ".", "The", "module", "processes", "approximately", "10", "GB", "of", "data", "every", "second", "with", "tiny", "(", "~100ns", ")", "latencies", ".", "The", "trigger", "system", "selects", "in", "real", "time", "a", "tiny", "interesting", "fraction", "from", "the", "bulk", "of", "proton", "-", "proton", "collisions", "for", "storage", ".", "The", "first", "level", "(", "\"", "Level", "1", "\"", ")", "of", "this", "processing", "is", "accomplished", "in", "dedicated", "electronics", "hardware", ".", "The", "CMX", "will", "fit", "within", "the", "Level", "1", "system", "and", "count", "objects", "such", "as", "electrons", ",", "jets", ",", "tau", "leptons", ".", "It", "will", "also", "forward", "full", "object", "information", "over", "24", "multi", "-", "gigabit", "optical", "links", "for", "further", "topological", "processing", ".", "Previously", "I", "helped", "to", "commission", "ATLAS", "High", "Level", "Trigger", "(", "HLT", ")", ".", "The", "HLT", "processes", "the", "data", "that", "have", "been", "selected", "by", "the", "Level", "1", "system", "and", "selects", "a", "fraction", "of", "these", "collisions", "for", "final", "storage", ".", "I", "have", "taken", "numerous", "leadership", "roles", ".", "In", "the", "context", "of", "the", "trigger", "upgrade", "project", "I", "have", "been", "co", "-", "coordinating", "the", "commissioning", "efforts", "for", "the", "CMX", "board", "and", "coordinating", "the", "work", "of", "three", "other", "firmware", "developers", ".", "I", "led", "large", "teams", "of", "researchers", "during", "the", "early", "searches", "for", "the", "high", "mass", "particles", "and", "later", "coordinated", "the", "work", "of", "10", "analysis", "teams", ".", "I", "chaired", "and", "sat", "on", "several", "internal", "publication", "review", "committees", ".", "I", "supervised", "graduate", "and", "undergraduate", "students", "."], "record": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_0> research interests <extra_id_5> searches for new heavy particles <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> work record <extra_id_5> I led large teams of researchers during the early searches for the high mass particles and later coordinated the work of 10 analysis teams .

{"text": "Elisabetta Dejana , a cell biologist and expert on regulation of vascular system development , directs the New strategies to inhibit tumor angiogenesis research unit at IFOM , which focuses on development of tumor vasculature . After earning a degree in Biological Sciences from the University of Bologna , she moved to Milan to work at the Mario Negri Institute for Pharmacological Research , where she investigated the mechanisms underlying pathological thrombosis and cardiovascular diseases . Her research brought her to McMaster University in Canada between 1978 and 1980 , where she worked with one of the leading research groups in her field . During this period , she developed techniques for the isolation and culturing of endothelial cells from blood vessel walls , in order to study their characteristics under normal and pathological conditions . Back in Italy , she set up the Laboratory of Vascular Biology at the Mario Negri Institute in Milan , which she directed until 1993 , with alternating periods of work abroad at Harvard Medical School in Boston , Hpital Bictre in Paris and Hadassah Medical School in Jerusalem . She continued to study vascular cell biology , but during that period , her research assumed a new goal : understanding angiogenesis , the process through which new blood vessels form , both in the embryo and during the growth of a tumor . Angiogenesis is a limiting factor for tumor expansion because the cancerous mass depends on the vascular system to provide it with the nourishment and oxygen that it needs to grow . Blocking this process may provide the means for stopping cancer , but much remains to be discovered in order to identify the most effective therapies for this purpose . Elisabetta Dejana continued to focus her research in this direction , from 1993 to 1996 as director of the Laboratoire d ' hmatologie Centre d ' tudes Nuclaires in Grenoble , France . Returning to Italy , she participated in the FIRC project to create a new institute dedicated to cancer research and when IFOM was established in 2000 , she was among the first scientists to set up her laboratory there . She directed the establishment of an IFOM research program to study angiogenesis and develop therapeutic strategies to inhibit tumor growth by targeting this pathway . From an academic point of view , Elisabetta Dejana has given courses in vascular biology at several European Universities ; then , in 1998 she became Associate Professor of General Pathology at the University of Insubria in Varese , Italy . Since 2002 , she has held the position of full Professor in the same field at the University of Milan . Elisabetta Dejana has authored over 300 scientific articles published in prestigious international journals with almost 20 , 000 personal citations and has received numerous awards and recognitions from various Italian and International scientific associations . During her scientific career she has dedicated a considerable effort to improve scientific communication for the general public .

{"text": "Sidney Pestka ( born May 29 , 1936 ) is an American biochemist and geneticist who is Emeritus Professor of the Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology at Robert Wood Johnson Medical School of Rutgers University . A recipient of the National Medal of Technology , he is sometimes referred to as the \" father of interferon \" for his groundbreaking work developing the interferons as treatments for major diseases such as hepatitis , multiple sclerosis , and cancer . Pestka was part of the team working on research involving the genetic code , protein synthesis and ribosome function that led to the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine received by Marshall Warren Nirenberg . Sidney Pestka was born on May 29 , 1936 in the Polish town of Drobin , which is located in what is now known as Pock County ( \" powiat pocki \" ) . His family emigrated to the United States a few years later . When he was a young boy , he began inventing devices . \" It was stimulating to see chemicals change the color of fluids , to construct crystal radios , and to make caramel from sugarhowever , my mothers pots and pans were never the same afterward . It seemed that I constantly thought about new ideas to implement . As a teenager I developed an electronic security key and many other devices , but I did not know about patents at that time . \" Both his parents encouraged his curiosity ; his mother taught him mathematics when he was very young and his father shared his own hobby of building bicycles with basic parts .

{"text": "Pieter van Zwieten was born in Heemstede , the Netherlands in 1937 . After high school and having finished his study in Pharmacology he started a career as an investigator and moved to Kiel , Germany to continue his research under the guidance of professors Kuschinsky and Lllmann , who were to become his lifelong friends . After his Habilitation in Germany , Pieter van Zwieten , at the age of 34 years , was offered a professorship of Pharmacology and Pharmacotherapy at the University of Amsterdam . He quickly transformed the pharmacology laboratory into a modern research centre . He soon became known as a compassionate investigator in cardiovascular pharmacology and also drastically modernized the pharmacology curriculum . The first results of the research activities of the van Zwieten research group appeared in the early seventies of the last century but the highlights of the scientific production of his group appeared in the early 80s . Pieter van Zwieten was an inspiring but demanding person and his scientific staff had a similar drive and style . This resulted in a critical scientific mass where competence and competition , supported by excellent facilities , excellent laboratory staff and intense labour created an atmosphere of mutual stimulation . This scientific environment was extremely beneficial for talented students from multiple disciplines including pharmacy , chemistry , biology and medicine to start their academic career in a structured manner . The numerous national and international contacts of Pieter van Zwieten and the availability of new cardiovascular therapeutics from pharmaceutical companies provided an excellent basis for the development of novel pharmacological concepts . The Pieter van Zwieten group developed several efficient experimental animal models . The extensive experience with these models , which served as important pharmacological tools , was instrumental for the reliable scientific output of the group . The most spectacular animal model , both for research and teaching was the so called blood pressure cat where a wide range of pharmacological interventions could be tested in vivo and could be demonstrated to the students . Other animal models included the in vivo vertebral artery cat model to investigate CNS activity of cardiovascular drugs and the pithed rat that was used to characterize peripheral effects of cardiovascular drugs . This last model has yielded important discoveries including the distinction between alpha - 1 and alpha - 2 adrenoceptors , the involvement of calcium influx in adrenergic vasoconstriction , the role of presynaptic alpha - 2 adrenoceptors and dopamine receptors in sympathetic neurotransmission , the cardiovascular function of angiotensin converting enzyme and the role of 5 HT1A receptors in blood pressure regulation .", "tokens": ["Pieter", "van", "Zwieten", "was", "born", "in", "Heemstede", ",", "the", "Netherlands", "in", "1937", ".", "After", "high", "school", "and", "having", "finished", "his", "study", "in", "Pharmacology", "he", "started", "a", "career", "as", "an", "investigator", "and", "moved", "to", "Kiel", ",", "Germany", "to", "continue", "his", "research", "under", "the", "guidance", "of", "professors", "Kuschinsky", "and", "Lllmann", ",", "who", "were", "to", "become", "his", "lifelong", "friends", ".", "After", "his", "Habilitation", "in", "Germany", ",", "Pieter", "van", "Zwieten", ",", "at", "the", "age", "of", "34", "years", ",", "was", "offered", "a", "professorship", "of", "Pharmacology", "and", "Pharmacotherapy", "at", "the", "University", "of", "Amsterdam", ".", "He", "quickly", "transformed", "the", "pharmacology", "laboratory", "into", "a", "modern", "research", "centre", ".", "He", "soon", "became", "known", "as", "a", "compassionate", "investigator", "in", "cardiovascular", "pharmacology", "and", "also", "drastically", "modernized", "the", "pharmacology", "curriculum", ".", "The", "first", "results", "of", "the", "research", "activities", "of", "the", "van", "Zwieten", "research", "group", "appeared", "in", "the", "early", "seventies", "of", "the", "last", "century", "but", "the", "highlights", "of", "the", "scientific", "production", "of", "his", "group", "appeared", "in", "the", "early", "80s", ".", "Pieter", "van", "Zwieten", "was", "an", "inspiring", "but", "demanding", "person", "and", "his", "scientific", "staff", "had", "a", "similar", "drive", "and", "style", ".", "This", "resulted", "in", "a", "critical", "scientific", "mass", "where", "competence", "and", "competition", ",", "supported", "by", "excellent", "facilities", ",", "excellent", "laboratory", "staff", "and", "intense", "labour", "created", "an", "atmosphere", "of", "mutual", "stimulation", ".", "This", "scientific", "environment", "was", "extremely", "beneficial", "for", "talented", "students", "from", "multiple", "disciplines", "including", "pharmacy", ",", "chemistry", ",", "biology", "and", "medicine", "to", "start", "their", "academic", "career", "in", "a", "structured", "manner", ".", "The", "numerous", "national", "and", "international", "contacts", "of", "Pieter", "van", "Zwieten", "and", "the", "availability", "of", "new", "cardiovascular", "therapeutics", "from", "pharmaceutical", "companies", "provided", "an", "excellent", "basis", "for", "the", "development", "of", "novel", "pharmacological", "concepts", ".", "The", "Pieter", "van", "Zwieten", "group", "developed", "several", "efficient", "experimental", "animal", "models", ".", "The", "extensive", "experience", "with", "these", "models", ",", "which", "served", "as", "important", "pharmacological", "tools", ",", "was", "instrumental", "for", "the", "reliable", "scientific", "output", "of", "the", "group", ".", "The", "most", "spectacular", "animal", "model", ",", "both", "for", "research", "and", "teaching", "was", "the", "so", "called", "blood", "pressure", "cat", "where", "a", "wide", "range", "of", "pharmacological", "interventions", "could", "be", "tested", "in", "vivo", "and", "could", "be", "demonstrated", "to", "the", "students", ".", "Other", "animal", "models", "included", "the", "in", "vivo", "vertebral", "artery", "cat", "model", "to", "investigate", "CNS", "activity", "of", "cardiovascular", "drugs", "and", "the", "pithed", "rat", "that", "was", "used", "to", "characterize", "peripheral", "effects", "of", "cardiovascular", "drugs", ".", "This", "last", "model", "has", "yielded", "important", "discoveries", "including", "the", "distinction", "between", "alpha", "-", "1", "and", "alpha", "-", "2", "adrenoceptors", ",", "the", "involvement", "of", "calcium", "influx", "in", "adrenergic", "vasoconstriction", ",", "the", "role", "of", "presynaptic", "alpha", "-", "2", "adrenoceptors", "and", "dopamine", "receptors", "in", "sympathetic", "neurotransmission", ",", "the", "cardiovascular", "function", "of", "angiotensin", "converting", "enzyme", "and", "the", "role", "of", "5", "HT1A", "receptors", "in", "blood", "pressure", "regulation", "."], "record": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_0> birth place <extra_id_5> Heemstede , the Netherlands <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> birthday <extra_id_5> 1937 <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> gender <extra_id_5> his <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> work record <extra_id_5> After his Habilitation in Germany , Pieter van Zwieten , at the age of 34 years , was offered a professorship of Pharmacology and Pharmacotherapy at the University of Amsterdam .
