Dr. Kerr spent most of his exemplary career as a phytopathologist at the University of Adelaide. His previous honors include the Ruth Alen and E. C. Stakman awards, the Walter Burfitt Prize of the Royal Society of New South Wales, and the inaugural Ausralia Prize. He was elected a Fellow of the Australasian Plant Pathology Society, the Australian Academy of Science, and the Royal Society, a Foreign Associate of the U.S. National Academy of Sciences, and an officer of the Order of Australia.\nDr. Kerrs early research was on the soilborne fungi Rhizoctonia, Fusarium, and Pythium, with special reference to host-parasite relationships, interactions among pathogens, and influence of soil moisture on infection. During his tenure at the Tea Research Institute in Sir Lanka, he studied the epidemiology of blister blight of tea, developed a model relating disease incidence to weather, and successfully integrated the model with a user-friendly calculating device for implementation of effective control of this disease.\nIn Dr. Kerrs own words, however, My most important work has been a study of crown gall, one of the three known plant cancers. It is the only cancer, of either plant or animal, induced by a bacterium. His work on this disease began in 1967, as an ecological study of agrobacteria in soil and on the roots of stone-fruit trees. It resulted in significantly improved understanding of the ecology and biology of the pathogen, and a unique and widely adopted biological method for control of the disease. Dr. Kerrs findings and scientific leadership facilitated numerous cooperative projects with graduate and postgraduate students and colleagues throughout the world. Strain K1026, the genetically engineered organism for crown gall control, was the first such organism registered as a pesticide and released for general use. Dr. Kerrs research led to the characterization of the chemistry of Agrocin 84, a new and very potent antibiotic with marked specificity. Other major contributions include fundamental research on the nature of bacterial conjugation, plasmid transfer, and conjugation factors. This work was of crucial importance in demonstrations by others that pathogenicity in Agrobacterium is encoded by the Ti plasmid. In addition to his investigations of crown gall of stone fruit, Dr. Kerr has conducted research on the transformation and regeneration of flax, control of cane gall disease of grapes, and annual ryegrass toxicity.\nDr. Kerr has served the science of phytopathology as president of the Australasian Plant Pathology Society, as vice-president of the International Society for Plant Pathology, and in numerous other capacities.",

Since such structures have been difficult to study by standard crystallographic and magnetic resonance techniques, we are developing direct imaging techniques of such purified complexes using high powered scanning transmission electron microscopy. Computer-assisted image processing, largely with novel programs written by students in-house, then converts the two-dimensional electron micrographs into three-dimensional structures. Well over a dozen different proteins and complexes have been and are being studied, including the drug-transporting P-glycoprotein important in cancer chemotherapy, the insulin receptor complex provides a cellular transmembrane signal in the presence of insulin, and the Mu A transpososome that is responsible for one aspect of DNA recombination. As a recent example of work in progress, the structure of the insulin receptor in the presence of insulin has been solved by us with such detail, that not only the interactions of the amino acid side chains in the insulin binding site could be elucidated, but that the mechanics of transmembrane signalling could be determined (1,2).\nSimultaneous with this work, we are developing analytical techniques in electron microscopy that take advantage of the physics of the interaction of the electron beam with different energy levels within the atoms and chemical structures within specimens, from nucleoprotein complexes to tissue sections. This includes the design and construction of high resolution electron energy filters (3,4) as well as the development of an entirely new field of microanalysis which we have called HIMEX, for high resolution imaging with molecular orbital excitations. Early demonstrative applications have included the imaging of the red hemoglobin, mercury orange, red chlorin e6 and the green fluorophore FITC, imaging with the colours that are normally used in light microscopy, but here obtaining a 200-fold better spatial detail (5). Developments to use green fluorescent proteins are currently underway.\nThe group generally comprises physics and engineering students interested in instrument development or image processing improvements, as well as biochemists and biologists working on specific important biological applications using the techiques being developed.",

UCS is a public interest group, supported by funds raised from the general public, that presses for control of technologies which may be harmful or dangerous. The organization has had an important national role in the controversies over nuclear reactor safety, the wisdom of the US Strategic Defense Initiative, the B2 (Stealth) bomber, and the challenge posed by fossil fuel burning and possible greenhouse warming of the atmosphere, among others. I have been Chairman of the organization since 1974. The activities of the organization are part of a slowly growing interest among scientists to take more responsibility for helping society control the exceedingly powerful technologies that scientific research has spawned. It is hard to conclude that scientists are in the main responsible for the damage and risks that are now so apparent in such areas as environmental matters and nuclear armaments; these have been largely the consequence of governmental and industrial imperatives, both here and abroad. Yet it seems clear that without scientists participation in the public debates, the chances of great injury to all humanity is much enhanced. In my view, the scientific community has not participated in this effort at a level commensurate with the need, nor with the special responsibilities that scientists ineluctably have in this area.\nThis expenditure of effort and the sense of responsibility to help achieve control of aberrant technologies which drives it, stems in no small measure from the example set by my Father, who, throughout his life, spent a great deal of time and no small amount of energy on quiet, pro bono work. He was not alone among his own friends  nor among his own contemporaries  in this; it has been a tradition in New England of very long standing. In continuing to pursue such objectives, my expectation is that the challenges facing both me and the Union will be made substantially easier by the award of the Nobel Prize.

To this end, I studied microbial diversity, microbial processes dynamics, microbial cycling, microbe-microbe and microbe-eukaryote interactions. I have extensive experience in isolating difficult to culture bacterial from soil, rhizosphere and plant material. Some of them part of the rare biosphere. For long time it was believed that some of these bacterial groups (e.g. particular groups of Acidobacteria and Verrucomicrobia) would remain uncultured.\nEarly in my career I studied the forces and interaction among difficult to culture bacteria and the soil matrix. Later, I changed my focus to the understanding of why bacterial groups would remain uncultured. At that moment, I realized that a deep understand of microbial physiology, microbe-microbe and microbe-abiotic matrix interactions are of great importance to diminish the culturability gap. I have also isolated many difficult to culture bacteria from the rhizosphere environment and performed bench, microcosm and field experiments to understand their ecology and cycle in soil-plant systems. My work has pinpointed that to shed light in the ecology of difficult to culture bacteria it is necessary to couple advanced culture-dependent and independent techniques.\nMy current interest focus on the understanding of how yet to be cultured bacteria are involved in processes important for human and environment health, such as climate change and bio-based products.  I am interest to understand the functional, regulatory and metabolic mechanisms that allow biofilms in areas with infrequent wetting to transition from a dormant dry state to an active wet state after a precipitation event and back to dormancy as they dry. Also, I am involved in the isolation of difficult to culture rhizosphere bacteria that will later be used to elucidate how soil organic matter decomposition in the rhizosphere is accelerated.

She was a software architect in the OS Base Core Technology group of Microsoft Corporation from 2000 to 2004. Before joining Microsoft, she was a professor of Computer Science Department at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign from 1973 to 2000.\nDr. Jane Liu's research interests has been in the areas of real-time and embedded systems, distributed systems, communication networks and personal and home automation and assistive devices. Prior to 2004, Dr. Jane Liu's research focused primarily on theories, algorithms, architectures and tools for building real-time and embedded systems from components, and validating their timing performance efficiently and reliably. In addition to journal and conference publications, she has also published two books, one on real-time systems and the other on signals and systems. She has led several development efforts, including the PERTS system of building blocks and tools and a kernel-level processor-reservation mechanism. The former supports the design, evaluation and validation of real-time systems. The latter protects time-critical applications and system components from adverse effects of processor contention and enables the timing behavior of independently developed components on an open platform to be tuned and assessed.\nHer recent research focuses on technologies for building personal and home automation and assistive devices and services. Some of them are primarily devices of convenience designed to enhance the quality of life and self-reliance of their users, including elderly individuals as well as people who are chronically ill or functionally limited. Other devices can also serve as point-of-care and automation tools for use at home and in care-providing institutions. Examples include smart medication dispensers and administration tools, autonomous home appliances and robotic helpers. Such a device must be affordable and easy to use. It should be easily configured to work with a variety of sensors and to rely on different support infrastructures. It should also be customizable according to its user's preferences and capable of adapting to changes in the user's needs, mindset and skills. A major thrust of her research has been directed towards developing system architectures, components, platforms and tools for building such devices and services at low-cost, including the development of an embedded workflow framework and a simulation environment. Recent results of this work and links to open source software projects can be found at the SISARL homepage http://sisarl.org.\nDr. Jane Liu was the editor-in-chief of IEEE Transactions on Computers from 1996-1999.

He was born in Canmore, Alberta in a Ukrainian family. Early in his career, Charyk consolidated the Central Intelligence Agency, United States Air Force, and United States Navy space programs into the National Reconnaissance Office (NRO). He brought the first United States imagery satellite, CORONA, into operation and demonstrated signals intelligence technology from space. During his tenure, the NRO operated the U-2 reconnaissance aircraft and managed development of the A-12.[2]\nCharyk served as Chief Scientist of the United States Air Force until he was appointed the Undersecretary of the Air Force. In 1961 he was appointed by President John F. Kennedy to be the first Director of the National Reconnaissance Office.[3] He later returned to aerospace industry, serving as first president of Communications Satellite Corporation. Charyk decided to make geosynchronous satellites the basis of the Comsat network. He fought skepticism that this untested technology would not work for voice transmission because of a half-second time delay. He also raised funds to support this new industry and enlisted the cooperation of countries around the world. His efforts launched a global system that would eventually seem commonplace to billions of people around the world. While at Comsat, Charyk served as President, CEO, and Chairman from 1963 to 1985.[4]\nCharyk earned his bachelors in Engineering and Physics from the University of Alberta and his PhD in Aeronautics from the California Institute of Technology. In 1973 Charyk was inducted into the National Academy of Sciences and National Academy of Engineering for \"basic contributions relating to space flight and leadership in development of communications satellites\".[5] In 1974 he received the International Emmy Directorate Award for his work with COMSAT.[6] In 1987 President Ronald Reagan awarded Charyk the National Medal of Technology and Innovation \"[f]or employment of the concept of the geosynchronous communications satellite systems as the basis for a global telecommunications system, established by international agreement, and for his guidance in the development and growth of the Intelsat system, which today services over 150 nations and territories\".[7] Charyk died on September 28, 2016 at the age of 96.",

Dam's key experiment involved feeding a cholesterol-free diet to chickens.[1] He initially replicated experiments reported by scientists at the Ontario Agricultural College (OAC).[2] McFarlane, Graham and Richardson, working on the chick feed program at OAC, had used chloroform to remove all fat from chick chow. They noticed that chicks fed only fat-depleted chow developed hemorrhages and started bleeding from tag sites.[3] Dam found that these defects could not be restored by adding purified cholesterol to the diet. It appeared thattogether with the cholesterola second compound had been extracted from the food, and this compound was called the coagulation vitamin. The new vitamin received the letter K because the initial discoveries were reported in a German journal, in which it was designated as Koagulationsvitamin.\nHe was born and died in Copenhagen.\nHe received an undergraduate degree in chemistry from the Copenhagen Polytechnic Institute (now the Technical University of Denmark) in 1920, and was appointed as assistant instructor in chemistry at the School of Agriculture and Veterinary Medicine. By 1923 he had attained the post of instructor in biochemistry at Copenhagen University's Physiological Laboratory. He studied microchemistry at the University of Graz under Fritz Pregl in 1925, but returned to Copenhagen University, where he was appointed as an assistant professor at the Institute of Biochemistry in 1928, and assistant professor in 1929. During his time as professor at Copenhagen University he spent some time working abroad, and in 1934 submitted a thesis entitled Nogle Undersgelser over Sterinernes Biologiske Betydning (Some investigations on the biological significance of the sterines) to Copenhagen University, and received the degree of Ph.D. in biochemistry.\nBetween 19421945 he was a Senior Research Associate at the University of Rochester; it was during this period that he was awarded the 1943 Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine.",

Arden (born in 1927 in Minneapolis, Minnesota) is an American computer scientist.\nHe graduated from Purdue University with a BS(EE) in 1949 and started his computing career in 1950 with the wiring and programming of IBM's hybrid (mechanical and electronic) Card Programmed Computer/Calculator at the Allison Division of General Motors. Next he spent a short period as a programmer for computations being done at the University of Michigan's Willow Run Laboratory using the Standards Eastern Automatic Computer.\nHe then became a Research Associate at the University of Michigan's Statistical Research Laboratory and later an Associate Director of the University's Computing Center after its establishment in 1959. While at Michigan he co-authored two compilers, GAT[1] for the IBM 650 and MAD[2] for the IBM 704/709/7090, was involved in the design of the architecture and negotiations with IBM over the virtual memory features that would be included in what became the IBM S/360 Model 67 computer, and in the initial design of the Michigan Terminal System (MTS) time-sharing operating system.[3]\nHis increasing interest in academic computer science and engineering motivated Arden to complete a doctoral program in Electrical Engineering in 1965. He was subsequently a professor in, and ultimately Chairman of, the Computer and Communication Sciences department at Michigan.[3] In 1973 he accepted a professorship at Princeton University and chaired the department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science.[4] In 1986, then Princeton's Alexander Doty Professor of Engineering, he went to the University of Rochester as its Dean of the College of Engineering and Applied Science. In the three years preceding the addition of \"Emeritus\" to his academic title (William May Professor of Engineering) in 1995, he also served as Rochester's Vice Provost for Telecommunications and Computing.[5]\nDuring his academic career, Bruce Arden wrote two books on numerical computation and edited another on computer science and engineering research. He wrote many papers in the areas of compilers, operating systems, computer logic and networks.[6] In addition, he supervised many students, both undergraduate and graduate, in their studies of the various aspects of computing, and he served as a consultant to government agencies and several major computer companies at various times during those years.\nHe is retired and lives in Michigan and Maine.",

        "text": "Born on September 13th 1944 in Montsalvy (Cantal department) I graduated from Ecole polytechnique (1965-1967). I then studied neurophysiology and automatic control and worked as a research engineer in a research association called Adersa, headed by Jacques Richalet. During my work I found a thesis subject consisting in looking for stable algorithms for identifying unstable systems. After an unsuccessful \"drop-out\" attempt in the region of Grenoble, I presented a \"doctorat dtat en sciences physiques\" thesis at INPG (1978).\nAt the same time I joined CNRS in Computer Science in Gabrile Saucier's team where I worked on fault-tolerant architectures, in particular with Jacques Pulou who taught me most of my computer science. Here, I met Nicolas Halbwachs and we worked together on formalisms for specifying timed systems. During this work I understood the remarkable adequacy that existed between data-flow concepts and formalisms used in automatic control. This gave me the idea of a programming language which I called LUSTRE (as an acronym for synchronous real-time Lucid). Developed by Nicolas Halbwachs, this language is both an industrial and scientific success and I am quite proud of this. This work and the friendly support of Grard Berry led us to win the Monpetit 2004 prize of the Acadmie des sciences.\nI then spent a lot of time trying to understand what synchrony meant, particularly with Albert Benveniste. Meanwhile, I discovered Philip Wadler's papers on \"listlessness\"and \"deforestation\". I then understood that synchrony was also a mean of efficiently dealing with lazy evaluation in functional programming. This originated my present work with Marc Pouzet.\nIn parallel, thanks to Gabrile Saucier, I was member of the SACEM committee of the French \"Ministre des transports\" who audited the safety computing system of \"RER A\" Paris underground. I worked a lot for this committee and I think I found a good proof for the safety process invented for this system by Philippe Forin from \"Matra-Transport\". Since then I am considered an expert in this field and, for instance, I acted as a scientific advisor for the safety system of the Lyon underground.",

Jacobs worked various jobs to pay for his bachelor's degree in chemical engineering from the Polytechnic Institute of Brooklyn and taught college while he earned his master's degree and doctorate in that field, 1939 and 1942, respectively.[2]\nAs a young engineer, he worked for Merck & Co. to develop mass production of both DDT and penicillin. In 1943, he was accidentally doused with hundreds of pounds of hot DDT when a hopper valve opened. Although coated with, by his own estimate, an inch of DDT from head to foot; Jacobs suffered no ill consequences from his exposure.\nAfter World War II, he moved to California, intending to go into business himself.[4]\nIn 1947, he opened a one-man consulting engineering business in Pasadena, California, where he and his wife made their home. Through both internal growth and external acquisitions, this grew into Jacobs Engineering Group, one of the largest engineering and construction companies in the world.\nHonors[edit]\nChairman of the Board of Trustees of Polytechnic University (Polytechnic Institute of Brooklyn)\nTrustee of Harvey Mudd College (Claremont, California)\nIn 1983, he received the Hoover Medal, which recognizes the civic and humanitarian achievements of professional engineers.[8]\nIn 1994, he was elected to membership in the National Academy of Engineering.

His economical and understated style had a strong influence on 20th-century fiction, while his life of adventure and his public image influenced later generations. Hemingway produced most of his work between the mid-1920s and the mid-1950s, and won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1954. He published seven novels, six short story collections, and two non-fiction works. Additional works, including three novels, four short story collections, and three non-fiction works, were published posthumously. Many of his works are considered classics of American literature.\nHemingway was raised in Oak Park, Illinois. After high school, he reported for a few months for The Kansas City Star, before leaving for the Italian front to enlist with the World War I ambulance drivers. In 1918, he was seriously wounded and returned home. His wartime experiences formed the basis for his novel A Farewell to Arms (1929).\nIn 1921, he married Hadley Richardson, the first of his four wives. The couple moved to Paris, where he worked as a foreign correspondent and fell under the influence of the modernist writers and artists of the 1920s \"Lost Generation\" expatriate community. He published his debut novel, The Sun Also Rises, in 1926. After his 1927 divorce from Richardson, Hemingway married Pauline Pfeiffer; they divorced after he returned from the Spanish Civil War, where he had been a journalist, and after which he wrote For Whom the Bell Tolls (1940). Martha Gellhorn became his third wife in 1940; they separated when he met Mary Welsh in London during World War II. He was present at the Normandy landings and the liberation of Paris.\nShortly after the publication of The Old Man and the Sea (1952), Hemingway went on safari to Africa, where he was almost killed in two successive plane crashes that left him in pain or ill health for much of his remaining life. Hemingway maintained permanent residences in Key West, Florida, (1930s) and Cuba (1940s and 1950s), and in 1959, he bought a house in Ketchum, Idaho, where he killed himself in mid-1961.",

She stayed in Oxford for her doctorate, but shifted her focus to biology, studying for her D.Phil. in the Laboratory of Molecular Biophysics where she was supervised by Prof Andrew Miller and Prof Sir David Phillips (later Lord Phillips). She was awarded a D.Phil. in 1985 for Structural and dynamic studies of biological macromolecules. During postdoctoral work at the University of Edinburgh she conducted inelastic neutron scattering experiments at the ILL in Grenoble to investigate the dynamic properties of collagen. She returned to Oxford to learn protein crystallography where in 1989, working with Prof Dave Stuart, she determined one of the first crystal structures of a cytokine, tumour necrosis factor (TNF). During the later part of her postdoctoral studies Yvonne contributed to the MRC AIDS directed programme, working on high resolution structural studies of HIV Reverse Transcriptase to guide the development of anti-virals. In 1991 Yvonne started her own research programme in the Department of Biochemistry at Oxford as a Royal Society University Research Fellow. She chose to focus on cell-to-cell signalling molecules, an abiding interest of hers that had been sparked by her studies on TNF, and over the following 25 or so years has developed a research theme centred on the molecular mechanisms underpinning function in cell surface signalling systems. Her current research aims to integrate high resolution mechanistic detail with lower resolution cellular context and is focused on cell guidance cues and Wnt signalling systems.\nIn 1999 Yvonne co-founded (with Dave Stuart) the Division of Structural Biology (STRUBI) in the Nuffield Department of Clinical Medicine at Oxford. She is currently Joint Head of STRUBI and Deputy Director of the Wellcome Trust Centre for Human Genetics. She is a Fellow of the Academy of Medical Sciences and a Member of EMBO.",

My father, who was a G.P. died unexpectedly in his early 40s when I was 6 years old.   It was the depths of the depression in 1932 and my mother was destitute and ill.  She wisely chose to apply to place me at the age of 8 in Girard,  to which I remain very loyal and grateful for its high educational and caring standards.  Nearing leaving age at 18 at Girard, and knowing that I wanted to go to University, I applied to several in the Pennsylvania area, explaining that I would need support.  Swarthmore College came through first with a working scholarship  in return for my working as a waiter and other chores I was granted an academic scholarship and room and board.  I started reading physics in 1944 but was soon drafted into the U.S. Army during the 2nd World War.  Upon my return to Swarthmore after the war, and with the support of the G.I. Bill I started over again from scratch , reading philosophy, English literature, and psychology, finally majoring in psychology.\nThe move to the U.K. was due mainly to serial serendipity.  Just before I graduated from Swarthmore in 1949 it offered me a newly created Catherwood fellowship for one year, and I chose to go to Oxford, after which I returned to the States.  Later, out of the blue, the U.S. National Academy of Sciences offered me a one-year post-graduate fellowship in 1955, and I returned to Oxford. While there I was tempted by an invitation to Cambridge for a few years, which stretched into 11 years, ending with my return to Oxford as Professor Psychology in 1967.",

        "text": "Research Focus\nDesign and Study of Molecular Catalysts for Small Molecule Conversion\nCH4 (and other light alkanes in Natural Gas), N2, O2, H2O and CO2 are among the most abundant raw materials on Earth. Chemical reactions of these small molecules generate most of the worlds energy, emissions and materials. However, in spite of a century of research, current technologies still operate at higher costs, generate substantially more emissions and lead to greater dependence on petroleum than required. At the foundation of these inefficiencies is the high strength of the bonds in all of the small molecules.  In spite of intensive effort over more than 50 years, failure to develop chemistry to controllably make and break these bonds has led to the unfortunate assignment of these small molecule challenges as Holy Grails in chemistry.  The focus of our research is to overcome these challenges through the design of next generation catalysts for the direct, selective, conversion of these molecules.  One particular emphasis continues to be the design of systems that will enable the direct conversion of alkanes to fuels and chemicals at lower temperatures. This could replace or augment the use of petroleum with cleaner, more abundant Natural Gas as a transition to a cleaner future.  Our approach is based on the rational, de novo design of molecular (s-called homogeneous or single-site) catalysts through an iterative process involving conceptual design, computational study, synthesis, characterization and study of reaction chemistry and mechanisms. Our research interests include the design of catalysts for: CH hydroxylation; CH aminations, N2 fixation, O2 activation and CO2 reduction.\n\nAwards & Professional Activities\nCo-Founder and Member of Board of Directors, Hyconix, Inc.

My first 10 or so professional years I co-managed a small family business in international trade, whilst dabbling with studies in linguistics and other topics as a pass-time. In the mid 90s I changed carreers and went into computational linguistics and speech technology full-time, and have gained about 15 years of research experience in these areas since.\nMy research interests are broad in scope, with human behaviour and human communication as the common denominator. For the past ten years I've been working with spoken dialogue systems, mostly by first attempting to ascertain experimentally how people behave in human-human interaction, and then to model this behaviour in the systems. I have partaken in the development of several spoken dialogue systems at Telia Research (the former name of Swedish telecom TeliaSonera's research department), at SRI International in Cambridge, and at and KTH in Stockholm (e.g. Telia travel booking service, SLT, AdApt, Higgins, the KTH Connector, and the KTH Reminder).\nHaving spend my recent past examining ways to make talking computers more responsive and human-like in the way they interact with people, for example by improving their turn-taking skills or by allowing them to use and understand feedback and backchannels, I currently spend my time collecting data that forms the foundation for models of human conversational behaviour on the one hand, and analysing such data on the other hand. I am particularly interested in the interactional aspects of conversations - the way the conversation billows and changes character as it goes along, and the phenomena that govern these changes. I still spend a fair deal of time investigating under what circumstances human-likeness is a good idea in a talking computer, and when it is superfluous or perhaps even a hindrance. Taking the opposite perspective, I'm interested the extent to which basic research can benefit from implementing models and theories in spoken dialogue systems.",

He moved to Toronto in 2000, chairing the Department of Zoology from 2000-2005. He also held an appointment in the Department of Botany.\nHis research interests include community ecology, evolutionary ecology, and behavioral ecology, mostly centered around plant-pollinator relationships. A theme that unifies much of this work has three components: How do flower-visiting animals perceive, sample, and learn about floral resources? How do these processes translate into foraging choices and patterns? How do those patterns affect pollen flow, reproductive success, allocation processes, and the evolution of floral characters in plants? Recent research programs include the development and testing of pollen presentation theory in the context of a phylogenetic analysis of pollination ecology and floral evolution in the large genus Penstemon, plus a range of work on bumble bees, including cognitive ecology and conservation biology. Recently, he has concentrated on long-term demographic studies of wild lilies in subalpine habitats in Colorado.\nHis teaching at U of T includes the very large first-year biology course BIO120, for which he shares lecturing duties with Professor Spencer Barrett (FRS, FRSC). An Editor of the Quarterly Review of Biology, he has also been an National Science Foundation Mid-Career Fellow, a Council member for the Society for the Study of Evolution, an editor for the Ecological Society of America, and President of the American Society of Naturalists.

        "text": "Professor Hellwarth's research is focused on understanding and developing materials for nonlinear optical devices. His research is particularly concentrated on polymers, suspensions, and photorefractive crystals, physics of optical glasses (especially ac oustic attenuation in glass), nonlinear imaging devices, wavefront reversal, and nonlinear optics for systolic-architecture computers. \nThe ultimate usefulness of nonlinear optics in many applications depends on the maximum nonlinearity possible. Professor Hellwarth has shown that for nominally transparent nonlinear materials, the minimum power required to perform a single logic function can never be below the average thermal energy per excitation divided by the optical-wave period. This value is well below that commonly used in practice. The significance of this result is not only to allow comparison among projected logic elements, bu t also to underscore the surprisingly low power thresholds for nonlinear effects that may be expected to be found at microwave and longer wavelengths. The first experimental evidence has been obtained for existence of such thresholds in specially construc ted materials. \nProfessor Hellwarth made the first observation of the hyperfine resonance absorption of a radioactive isotope. He was co-developer of the widely used \"precessing-vector\" model of two-level atoms. He witnessed the making of the first laser at the Hughes R esearch Laboratories in 1960, and became an early and continuing contributor to the new optics spawned by this development. He invented the technique of \"Q-switching,\" by which the peak optical power output of many common lasers may be made to rival the peak electrical power output of Hoover Dam. He was co-discoverer of a new kind of laser action, to which he gave its theoretical basis and the name, \"stimulated scattering.\" \nAt USC, Professor Hellwarth developed a new, and now widely employed, method for reversing the lightwave pattern of an optical image, a process often called \"optical beam phase conjugation.\" He also invented widely used laser-spectroscopic techniques, wh ich he named Raman-induced Kerr effect and Raman-induced phase-conjugation.",

        "text": "Forrester was born on a farm near Anselmo, Nebraska, where \"his early interest in electricity was spurred, perhaps, by the fact that the ranch had none. While in high school, he built a wind-driven, 12-volt electrical system using old car parts  it gave the ranch its first electric power.\"[3]\nForrester received his Bachelor of Science in Electrical Engineering in 1939 from the University of NebraskaLincoln, was inducted in 1949 into Eta Kappa Nu (HKN) the Electrical & Computer Engineering Honor Society, and went on to graduate school at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where he would spend his entire career. During the 1940s and early 50s, he did research in electrical and computer engineering, heading the Whirlwind project, perfecting magnetic-core memory,[4] and developing the \"multi-coordinate digital information storage device\"[5] (coincident-current system), the forerunner of today's RAM. He is also believed to have created the first animation in the history of computer graphics, a \"jumping ball\" on an oscilloscope.\nIn 1956, Forrester moved to the MIT Sloan School of Management, where he was Germeshausen Professor Emeritus and Senior Lecturer. In 1961, arising from a project with General Electric, he wrote about the expanding effects down the supply chains due to fluctuations in demand, thenceforth known as the \"Forrester effect\" or bullwhip effect.[4][6] In 1982, he received the IEEE Computer Pioneer Award.[7] In 1995, he was made a Fellow[8] of the Computer History Museum \"for his perfecting of core memory technology into a practical computer memory device; for fundamental contributions to early computer systems design and development\". In 2006, he was inducted into the Operational Research Hall of Fame.\nForrester was the founder of system dynamics, which deals with the simulation of interactions between objects in dynamic systems. Industrial Dynamics was the first book Forrester wrote using system dynamics to analyze industrial business cycles. Several years later, interactions with former Boston Mayor John F. Collins led Forrester to write Urban Dynamics, which sparked an ongoing debate on the feasibility of modeling broader social problems.\nThe urban dynamics model attracted the attention of urban planners around the world, eventually leading Forrester to meet a founder of the Club of Rome. He later met with the Club of Rome to discuss issues surrounding global sustainability; the book World Dynamics followed. World Dynamics took on modeling the complex interactions of the world economy, population and ecology, which was controversial (see also Donella Meadows and Limits to Growth). It was the start of the field of global modeling.[4] Forrester continued working in applications of system dynamics and promoting its use in education.",

Thus it seems logical that Dr. Hurst became one of the most revered and respected teachers of medicine and cardiology of his time.\nDr. Hurst was known for his love of teaching. \"I think teaching is the greatest profession there is,\" said Dr. Hurst. \"I've always found it exciting to try to crete an environment where young trainees, students, house officers, and fellows can learn. That's what I've tried to do.\" As a result of Dr. Hurst's success in building the cardiology program at Emory, a position as a cardiology resident in the Emory program became a highly-coveted prize. Seventy percent of living Emory Medical School alumni were overseen by Dr. Hurst in his position as Professor and Chairman of the Department of Medicine.\nAn outstanding teacher and writer, Dr. Hurst was also an excellent clinician, sought after by people across the nation and the world for cardiac care. Dr. Hurst served as personal cardiologist to former U.S. president Lyndon B. Johnson, as well as other government leaders.\nDr. Hurst was a post-graduate student and cardiac fellow under Dr. Paul Dudley White, the \"father of American cardiology,\" at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston. After completing his fellowship in Boston, Dr. Hurst came to Atlanta and went into private practice as one of only six cardiologists in the city. In addition to his practice of cardiology, he lectured, wrote, and taught.\nDr. Hurst began teaching at Emory in 1950, believing that his interests in teaching, writing, and research could best be pursued in the setting of academic medicine. In 1957, he was named Professor and Chairman of the Department of Medicine. During his 30 year tenure as chairman, Dr. Hurst recruited dozens of new faculty members to the School of Medicine, increasing the faculty from 14 to over 140 and developing a strong education program in medicine.\nAs knowledge and technology in medicine and cardiology grew, Dr. Hurst, who was one of the founding fathers of the Emory Clinic, worked to ensure that no one in the Atlanta area or Georgia would have to go elsewhere for care, particularly cardiac care. He achieved this goal by adding the finest teachers, researchers, and clinicians to the faculty of the School of Medicine; working to expand the research facilities at Emory; establishing the post-graduate program of continuing education; originating the Physician Assistant program; creating a cardiac catheterization laboratory on the Emory campus; and increasing the length of the cardiology training program, among other achievements.\nDr. Hurst was the author or editor of almost 400 scientific articles and over 60 books, including The Heart, widely considered to be the \"bible\" of cardiology.",

Speech title: local immune microenvironment and treatment strategy of liver cancer speech Abstract: nearly 700000 people die of hepatocellular carcinoma every year in the world, half of them occur in China. Liver cancer is considered to be an immune related disease. More and more evidence shows that immune microenvironment plays a double-edged sword role in the occurrence and development of liver cancer. On the one hand, anti-cancer immunity kills tumor cells and inhibits tumor growth; on the other hand, cancer promoting immunity promotes the formation of immune tolerance and induces tumor immune escape. The balance between tumor local anti-cancer and tumor promoting immunity is significantly related to the prognosis of patients. The stronger the tumor promoting immunity is, the better the prognosis is; and vice versa. A variety of mechanisms are involved in tumor immune escape, including the decrease or loss of tumor antigen, the establishment of immunosuppressive network by inducing regulatory T cells and myeloid derived suppressor cells, the expression of negative costimulatory molecules (such as CTLA-4, PD-1, PD-L1, B7-H3, etc.) and the consumption of IL-2. At present, the strategy of enhancing anti-cancer immunity combined with weakening tumor promoting immunity is widely accepted, including oncolytic virus injection, DC vaccine treatment, CIK treatment, adoptive CTL infusion, antibody therapy, etc. it has achieved good results in the application of liver cancer, and the combined immunotherapy may benefit more liver cancer patients.",

        "text": "Mutation of the p53 tumor suppressor gene is the most frequent lesion detected in cancer. Consequently, understanding the structure and function of the normal p53 protein and how it differs from the mutant p53 proteins that are commonly found in cancer patients' tumors should provide valuable information. When cells are induced to accumulate high levels of p53 by agents of stress such as DNA damage or hypoxia, they either undergo cell cycle arrest or programmed cell death. We and others have shown that p53 is a binding protein that can activate transcription from reporter templates bearing p53 binding sites. We have analyzed in detail the functional domains of p53 and how they are regulated by both covalent and non-covalent modifiers. A number of p53 t arget genes have been identified whose functions are relevant to cell arrest or apoptosis. However, in some cases p53 induces apoptosis in a transactivation-independent manner. Although p53 is widely studied there are several questions that remain about this important protein: How do cells transmit signals from genotoxic stress to activate p53? What are the downstream targets of p53 that are involved in its many functions in cells? What is the transactivation-independent function of p53 and how does it work? Finally, with respect to the central role that p53 plays in human cancer, can we use information derived from the basic research on this protein to develop p53-based cancer therapeutics? The search for answers to these and other questions are the basis for much of the work currently going on in our laboratory.\nThe cell cycle of higher eykaryotes requires the activity of a number of cyclin dependent protein kinases (CDKs). Although information has accumulated about how the CDKs themselves are regulated, less is known about the substrates of these enzymes whose phosphorylation leads to cell cycle regulation. An ongoing project in our laboratory is the study of a number of CDK substrates and how phosphorylation regulates their function. We are particularly interested in how CDKs affect DNA synthesis and DNA repair.",

        "text": "The focus of the lab is on the contribution of T cell subsets to the maintenance of protective immunity and prevention of autoimmune disease. A comprehensive understanding of complex biological information systems, including the immune system and nervous system, requires definition of cells that are genetically programmed to suppress signal transmission and inhibit cellular responses (1). While analysis of the immune system has defined a sublineage of CD4+ regulatory T cells that can inhibit excessive inflammatory immune responses, more recent studies have defined a lineage of regulatory CD8 T cells that are genetically programmed to inhibit development of autoantibody formation and SLE-like disease (2). These CD8+ Treg, which are programmed to inhibit the activation and expansion of follicular helper T cells (TFH), express a triad of surface receptors  CD44, CD122 and the inhibitory Ly49 receptor and a T cell receptor (TCR) that recognizes Qa-1peptide complexes expressed by TFH cells (3). These studies have fundamental relevance to understanding the immune system and suggest new approaches to the treatment of SLE and other autoimmune disorders.\nMore recent studies have extended the functional reach of the natural killer (NK) cell system to include regulation of adaptive T cell responses, suggesting new clinical strategies for elimination of autoreactive T cells that drive autoimmune disorders, including SLE (4), a murine model of MS, EAE (5), as well as a murine model of rheumatoid arthritis, termed collagen-induced arthritis (Leavenworth et al, 2011, in prep).\nFinally, studies of the differentiation of T-helper cells have defined an interaction between dendritic cells and T cells that regulates the development of Th1 cells and Th17 cells (Shinohara et al, 2006; 2008). Elaboration of the cytokines Osteopontin and IFN promotes the Th1 response and suppresses the Th17 response, establishing the pattern of T-helper cell differentiation displayed during the large majority of immune responses.",

He also had an interest in the natural world and became involved in the Boy Scouts, achieving the level of an Eagle Scout. Stanley particularly liked Boy Scout summer camp because he could get away from people, enjoy the beauty of nature, and read undisturbed. After he returned to California in 1960 as a faculty member of the new University of California, San Diego campus he often spent summers in the Sierra Nevada Mountains.\n \nLike his parents before him, Stanley as well as his older brother Donald, went to UC Berkeley for their undergraduate studies. Because his brother had chosen to study chemistry, Stanley decided to follow in his footsteps, mainly because he knew his brother would help him if had trouble with his courses. He had taken most of the undergraduate chemistry classes by the end of his junior year and as a senior took graduate courses and carried out a senior thesis research project. Stanley did extremely well at UC Berkeley and his first two published papers were based on his undergraduate research.\n \nWhen Stanley decided to go to graduate school, he consulted with several of his professors, who came up with a short list of schools they recommended. At the top of the list were the University of Chicago and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He applied to both, but after receiving a telegram from the University of Chicago in February of 1951 notifying him of his acceptance, including an offer of a teaching assistantship, he quickly accepted. Stanley graduated from UC Berkeley in June of 1951 and then headed for Chicago.\n \nDuring his first semester, in the fall of 1951, Stanley went to a seminar in which Professor Harold C. Urey presented his ideas about the origin of the solar system and the chemical events associated with this process. One of the points that Urey made was that the atmosphere of the primitive Earth was much different from the modern atmosphere and likely consisted of a highly reducing mixture of methane, ammonia, hydrogen sulfide and hydrogen. Urey further suggested that with such an atmosphere it might be possible to synthesize organic compounds that in turn could have provided the raw materials needed for the emergence of life. This seminar obviously left a lasting impression on Stanley because he could still remember aspects of the lecture many years later.",

        "text": "Dr. Eric Shoubridges laboratory focuses on the molecular genetics of mitochondrial diseases, in particular those that affect the function of the respiratory chain. Mitochondria are essential for a number of cellular processes such as heme and iron-sulfur cluster biosynthesis, and for aerobic energy production. Energy production occurs in the respiratory chain, a system composed of five multi-subunit enzyme complexes whose polypeptide components are encoded in both the nuclear and mitochondrial genomes (mtDNA). Although only a handful of polypeptides are encoded in mtDNA, all are essential. Defects in respiratory chain function have been linked to a wide spectrum of multi-system disorders, often referred to as encephalomyopathies because of the prominent involvement of the nervous system and skeletal muscle. These defects have an estimated prevalence of one in every five thousand births. Defects can be caused by mutations in nuclear genes or in mtDNA.\nThe genetics of mtDNA is completely different from Mendelian genetics because of the high ploidy of mtDNA and because it is inherited maternally. Most cells contain hundreds or thousands of copies of mtDNA. In patients with mitochondrial disease, pathogenic mtDNAs usually co-exist with wild-type mtDNAs (heteroplasmy). In general, the proportion of mutant mtDNAs must exceed a particular threshold to produce a biochemical phenotype, so the rules that govern the transmission of mtDNA in the female germline, and the segregation of mutant mtDNAs in different tissues during fetal and postnatal life, are important determinants of the expression of a pathogenic phenotype, specific tissue involvement, and the severity of disease. The factors affecting the transmission and segregation of pathogenic mtDNA mutants remain, however, poorly understood. Using biochemical and genetic approaches, we are investigating the structural organization of mtDNA, and the nature of the nuclear genetic factors that influence its transmission and segregation.\nMost nuclear genetic effects affecting respiratory chain function are inherited as autosomal recessive traits. These are most prevalent in the pediatric population, where they are associated with severe respiratory chain dysfunction and an early fatal outcome. Using functional complementation cloning techniques in cell lines from patients, we are identifying and characterizing the genes associated with these disorders. The vast majority of these deficiencies result from an inability to assemble one or more of the respiratory chain complexes. This has led us to investigate the pathways of assembly of the individual enzyme complexes as well as the mitochondrial translation system that synthesizes the essential structural components encoded in mtDNA.",

Norman is renowned for his work on quantitative risk assessment, which typically involves analysing and predicting the probabilities of unknown events using Bayesian statistical methods including especially causal, probabilistic models. This type of reasoning enables improved assessment by taking account of both statistical data and also expert judgment.  Norman's experience in risk assessment covers a wide range of application domains such as legal reasoning (he has been an expert witness in major criminal and civil cases), medical trials, vehicle reliability, embedded software, transport systems, and financial services. Norman has a special interest in raising public awareness of the importance of probability theory and Bayesian reasoning in everyday life (including how to present such reasoning in simple lay terms) and he maintains a website dedicated to this. Norman has published 6 books and over 100 referred articles and has provided consulting to many major companies world-wide. He is currently involved in a number of project with medical practitioners and researchers, mathematicians and computer scientists, investigating how improved data-analysis can transform healthcare in the UK.

        "text": "I began to study Chinese language and history as an undergraduate in the late 1960s, in the era when Americans could not go to China. It was not until several years after I got my Ph.D. that I visited China for the first time. It has been amazing to watch the changes that have occurred in China since my first visits in 1978 and 1980. There can be few transformations in history that have occurred so rapidly. Perhaps as a result, my interest in China and its history has never flagged.\nIn the forty years since I started working on my dissertation, I have shifted from one set of questions to another several times. I started out thinking of myself as a social historian; I wanted to see if I could do research not just on the most famous intellectuals or political figures, but the broader elite stratum, at least. I began studying the early imperial period, the Han through Tang dynasties, but by about 1980 was moving into the Song period. At that point I was also shifting to family history, including issues of property and ritual. By 1990 I was also turning toward women's history. In the 1980s and early 1990s I was particularly attracted to the work of anthropologists and tried to find ways to pursue the questions they asked from the primary sources available for Song China. In the mid 1990s my interest turned toward the visual side of culture. By the end of the 1990s I was focusing on the Song emperor Huizong (r. 1100-1125), who was himself an artist, patron of artists, and art collector on a large scale.\nBesides studies aimed at other scholars of Chinese history, I have regularly tried to write for broader audiences, especially university students. My first effort was to compile a sourcebook of translations of Chinese texts that I thought would make lively reading in Chinese history classes. Later I was asked to write a history of China for the general public, which, while not originally intended for classroom use, is now quite commonly used in survey courses. That led to an invitation to join a team writing a world history textbook, and after that to develop a new history of East Asia. Although I have not lost my love of nitty-gritty research in original sources, I enjoy knowing that a lot of students are reading things I have written.\nWhat will I work on next? With my biography of Huizong now in press, I am ready to move on to something different. My current thought is to pose the question of why China has been the largest country in the world for much of its history and try to answer it by looking at the Sui-Tang-Song period.\nIn terms of training graduate students, I can offer the most help on the Tang-Song period, but am open to a wide range of questions and approaches.",

        "text": "Kevin Karplus taught at Cornell University for four years before joining the UCSC faculty. At UCSC, his research interests changed from VLSI CAD tools to bioinformatics. Work as part of the UCSC bioinformatics group includes protein-structure prediction, evaluating methods for estimating distributions of amino acids given just a few instances from the distribution, and design of a SIMD parallel computer that is particularly good for sequence alignment and linear HMM training ( Kestrel ). \nSince 1993 he has worked in bioinformatics---analyzing the vast databases created by high-throughput biological experimentation, such as the human genome project. He has used several techniques from machine learning and Bayesian statistics, including hidden Markov models (HMMs), mixtures of Dirichlet priors, and neural networks. \nMost recently, he has concentrated on automatic techniques for finding remotely related proteins using sequence information to build HMMs. These techniques have been applied to protein structure prediction, and he lead teams participating in the Critical Assessment of Structure Prediction experiments ( CASP2 1996, CASP3 1998, and CASP4 2000). The group did quite well in these blind prediction experiments in all three attempts (in the top 6 groups worldwide for fold recognition), and hope to continue to do well this year. \nThe group lead by Karplus has also built secondary structure predictors, using the multiple alignments created for the HMM search, neural networks, and some new techniques using HMMs for secondary structure prediction. An early version of this secondary structure predictor was one of the best two in 1998 (CASP3) and continues to be in the best group in the EVA evaluation. (It also did quite well at CASP4, but that evaluation was over too small a set of proteins to distinguish between the good predictors.) \nThe group has installed a web server providing free access to our methods ( http://www.soe.ucsc.edu/research/compbio/HMM-apps), and have licensed the HMM software to many research groups (free to academics, governments, and non-profits, with a moderate fee to industry). \nProf. Karplus and his students are currently working on different approaches to protein structure prediction, including some different secondary-structure prediction techniques using HMMs and a fragment-packing approach that combines homology modeling, fold recognition, and ab initio prediction into a single framework. The fragment-packing method is similar in concept, though not in detail, to the highly successful methods of David Baker's group at University of Washington. ",

After graduating from Pocahontas High School in 1954, he enrolled at Virginia State University. In 1956, Finney transferred to Virginia Polytechnic Institute, where he was one of the first African American students to integrate the university. Finney earned his B.S. degree in agricultural engineering in 1959 from Virginia Polytechnic Institute. He went on to earn his M.S. degree in 1960 from Pennsylvania State University, and in 1963, he was the first African American to receive his Ph.D. degree from the Department of Agricultural Engineering at Michigan State University. Between 1963 and 1965, Finney served as an officer in the United States Military.\nIn 1965, Finney accepted a position with the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)'s Beltsville Research Center in the instrumentation research laboratory. He was appointed assistant director of the center in 1977 and became director in 1989. For one year, Finney served as associate director of the Agricultural Research Service (ARS) twelve-state North Atlantic Area. In addition, from 1980 to 1981, he was hired as a senior policy analyst in the Office of the Science Advisor to Presidents Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan. In 1992, Finney went to work at the USDA headquarters in Washington, D.C. where he served as the associate administrator for the ARS. Finney worked with the USDA until his retirement in 1995. In addition to his administrative duties, Finney also conducted research. His early research investigated methods of drying cereal grains like wheat, rice, and barley, and his later research focused on techniques and instruments that measure food quality.",

Since May 2011, I have also been an Energy Analyst in the carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology group at the International Energy Agency in Paris, France. In CCS, carbon dioxide (CO2) is captured from a large point source, such as a refinery or power plant, compressed, and transported to a suitable location where it is injected into a geological formation (i.e., porous rock) deep underground.\nI work primarily on policy issues related to CCS technology (e.g., design of policies to drive CCS deployment, impacts of innovation on emissions reductions potential), but also deal regularly with topics in other areas such as CO2-flood enhanced oil recovery (EOR), and generation technology options for future electricity markets. I am mainly interested in issues at the intersection of energy and the environment, such as those relating to lifecycle impacts of fossil fuel use, water-use for energy technologies, and adaptation to climate change. I also have a growing interest in the way that researchers interact with policy makers (and those that support them) to develop technology and energy policy.\nPrior to the IEA, I was the project manager for the CCS Regulatory Project, referred to as CCSReg. The CCSReg project was a collaborative project to design a regulatory framework for carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) in the United States. The results of the project were published in a monograph by RFF Press in 2013.\nI received my Ph.D. in Engineering and Public Policy from Carnegie Mellon University in May 2008. In my PhD dissertation (PDF), I developed a set of engineering and economic models and used them to analyze the economics of carbon sequestration under different circumstances. These models are designed to complement the Integrated Environmental Control Model (IECM), also developed at Carnegie Mellon. If you would like access to the models, please email me.",

I earned a bachelor's degree in computer science from UC Berkeley in spring 2004 and a Master's degree in information science from UC Berkeley in spring 2006, and have completed the requirements for a PhD minor in anthropology at Stanford. My current research explores the social meanings of new media technologies. My dissertation work involves the technological dreams that are part of the One Laptop Per Child (OLPC) project's \"XO\" laptop: the hopes of OLPC developers and realities of students, teachers, and parents. I am focusing on the pilot deployment of 9000 laptops in Paraguay, where I am part of the OLPC volunteer intern program, and the country-wide deployment of 400,000 laptops in Uruguay. In collaboration with Nokia Research Center Palo Alto, I have also explored the socioeconomic divides in family practices and parent attitudes around communication and media technologies including computers, video games, mobile phones, and video conferencing in the United States.\nI began my research career in human-computer interaction as an undergraduate at UC Berkeley and quickly became fascinated with the deeper social questions concerning technology that I encountered while working on ambient display research with Professors Jennifer Mankoff and Anind Dey (now at CMU). For my master's degree, I worked with Professor Nancy Van House and Yahoo! Research exploring the social meanings of new photographic technologies, particularly cameraphones and online photo-sharing. Other past research projects include technology and the city (with Intel Research), methods of technology evaluation (at the University of Washington), and the implications of technology in economic development discourse. I am also interested in other topics in science and technology studies, new media, gender studies, human-computer interaction, and design.\nMy research is at the crossroads of science and technology studies, anthropology, and human-computer interaction. I draw on a diverse skill-set in my research, from an understanding of computer science systems and theory to a sociological perspective on everyday life. My recent investigations particularly utilize ethnographic research methods, bringing a deep qualitative and critical perspective to human-computer interaction debates about the ways in which we make sense of the technologies in our everyday lives.",

        "text": "Ulf S. von Euler was born in Stockholm, the son of two noted scientists, Hans von Euler-Chelpin, a professor of chemistry, and Astrid Cleve, a professor of botany and geology. His father was German and the recipient of Nobel Prize for Chemistry in 1929, and his maternal grandfather was Per Teodor Cleve, Professor of Chemistry at the Uppsala University, and the discoverer of the chemical elements thulium and holmium. His great-great-great-great grandfather was Leonhard Euler.\nEnjoying such a privileged family environment in science, education and research, it is not surprising that young Ulf would become a scientist, too, so he went to study medicine at the Karolinska Institute in 1922. At Karolinska, he worked under Robin Fhraeus in blood sedimentation and rheology and did research work on the pathophysiology of vasoconstriction. He presented his doctoral thesis in 1930, and was appointed as Assistant Professor in Pharmacology in the same year, with the support of G. Liljestrand. From 1930 to 1931, von Ulf got a Rochester Fellowship to do his post-doctoral studies abroad. He studied in England with Sir Henry Dale in London and with I. de Burgh Daly in Birmingham, and then proceeded to the continent, studying with Corneille Heymans in Ghent, Belgium and with Gustav Embden in Frankfurt, Germany. Von Euler liked to travel, so he also worked and learned biophysics with Archibald Vivian Hill, again in London in 1934, and neuromuscular transmission with G. L. Brown in 1938. From 1946 to 1947, he worked with Eduardo Braun-Menndez in the Instituto de Biologa y Medicina Experimental in Buenos Aires, which was founded by Bernardo Houssay. His unerring instinct to work with important scientific leaders and fields was to be proved by the fact that Dale, Heymans, Hill and Houssay went to receive the Nobel prize in physiology or medicine.\nIn 1981, von Euler became a founding member of the World Cultural Council.[7]\nFrom 1930 to 1957, von Euler was married to Jane Sodenstierna. They had four children: Hans Leo, scientist administrator at the National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, U.S.A.; Johan Christopher, anesthesiologist, Serafimer Hospital, Stockholm; Ursula Katarina, Ph.D., curator at The Royal Collections, The Royal Court, Stockholm, Sweden; and Marie Jane, Chemical Engineer, Melbourne, Australia. In 1958, von Euler married countess Dagmar Cronstedt, a radio broadcaster who had during the Second World War worked at Radio Knigsberg, broadcasting German propaganda to neutral Sweden.",

I spent several years as Associate Director of a University computer centre, managing computer operations, systems programming, communications and user services.\nMy research has centred on the issue of locality of reference in algorithms, a property that is essential to the efficiency of an algorithm in a number of apparently different environments, such as cache memories, external memory algorithms, and parallel/network computing. I am interested in both the theory and the practicality of such techniques, and my publications have typically presented both theoretical and implementation results.\nFor the past several years I have taught NET3004 (Data Structures) and NET4003 (Computer Architecture) at Carleton, one in each of the Fall and Winter terms. \nRecently, via my consulting activities, I have become involved with architectures and technologies for delivering information services over the Internet. This has included such diverse topics as Enterprise Applications and Information Architectures, Service Oriented Architectures, Web services, content syndication, J2EE, .NET, Web Portals, tradeoffs between server side and client side processing, and Content Management Systems. This reflects a growing tendency for large clients to convert their information infrastructure to use existing and emerging Internet standards. Examples include the use of lightweight clients based on Internet browsers to deliver services, and the identification of shared services that can be accessed programmatically via web services (from both inside and outside the firewall).",

He joined the National Research Council (NRC) in 1984 as a Research Officer and became a Senior Research Officer in 1992, having worked in the private sector for a number of years before joining NRC.\nFazel's research interests include machine learning, data pre-processing, constructive induction, bioinformatics, disease modeling based on genomics and proteomics data, and knowledge discovery from on-line data. His research currently focuses on data mining, automated knowledge discovery, bioinformatics and disease modeling using functional genomics data.\nIn 1999, Fazel initiated the BioMine project, for which is the Project Leader. BioMine is a joint data mining in genomics and bioinformatics project between the NRC Institute for Information Technology (NRC-IIT) and the NRC Institute for Biological Sciences (NRC-IBS), which is partially funded by the Genome Health Initiative. Other collaborators in the project include the NRC Plant Biotechnology Institute (NRC-PBI), the NRC Institute for Marine Biosciences (NRC-IMB) and the Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario. The BioMiner data mining infrastructure, developed as a result of research and development in this project, is currently being used for gene identification, gene response classifications and disease modeling in several applications.\nFazel also initiated the ADAM project in 1994, to conduct R&D in the area of data mining and automated knowledge discovery for fleet monitoring of commercial aircraft. He initiated and managed an Intelligent Supervisory System project, the result of which was a generic data mining software - IMAFO - which has since been commercialised by Quadrillion Corp. in Ottawa.\nThe IMAFO software applies machine learning techniques to analyse real world data to assist engineers and operators in data mining / management, quality control, process optimisation, planning, scheduling, and process monitoring of industrial processes (e.g., semiconductor manufacturing). The software has been licensed to Mitel Corporation and Gennum semiconductor manufacturing companies. Fazel has also developed a rule-based integrity mechanism for a relational database.\nFazel received an NRC Outstanding Achievement Award in 1994 and an NRC Institute for Information Technology Outstanding Achievement Award in 1993. He has published more than 20 articles in refereed scientific journals and conference proceedings, as well as one book, Artificial Intelligence Applications in Manufacturing (MIT / AAAI Press, 1992). He has also contributed chapters to two different books on data analysis and manufacturing databases.\nIn addition to conducting research at NRC, Fazel often supervises graduate students in computer science at Canadian universities and is frequently sought as an external examiner for PhD candidates.

Upon her arrival at the School, she proposed new directions including implementation of many of the 1982 self-study recommendations.\nShe instituted a new organizational structure. She requested that the School report to the Vice Chancellor for Health Affairs rather than to the Provost of the University as she believed this arrangement would enhance opportunities for joint programs and clinical training. Three new associate dean positions were established, which related directly to the tripartite mission of research, teaching and clinical practice. In 1999, a fourth associate dean, in Informatics, was added.\nUnder her guidance and direction, the School has reached out to the community in profound ways, such as communitybased clinics and practices. In addition to making a difference in Middle Tennessee, she has led the way for national impact via a variety of initiatives, such as the International Nursing Coalition for Mass Casualty Education and the National Coalition for Emergency Preparedness. She was appointed by President Reagan to his Presidential Commission on the HIV Epidemic in 1988 and by Speaker Newt Gingrich to the National Bipartisan Commission on the Future of Medicare in 1998. In 1997, she was named to the Institute of Medicine of the National Academy of Science. \nShe has spear-headed many projects, including the complete renovation of Godchaux Hall and the Nursing Annex, the building of Frist Hall with the addition of two floors on First Hall planned 2009, the PhD program in 1993, and the Doctor of Nursing Practice (DNP) program in 2008.

He began his career as a research assistant professor at the University of Illinois, where his research focused on the transport of electrons in MOS surface inversion layers and the theory of impurity centers in silicon. While at Illinois, he also worked to develop a theory related to the oxide-charge scattering of electrons in MOS inversion layers.\nIn 1973, Dr. Ning joined the Thomas J. Watson Research Center at IBM. In the early years of his career at IBM, he and his colleagues worked together to make major contributions to how we understand hot-electron effects and electron and hole trapping in MOSFETs. This included their discovery and demonstration of substrate-hot-electron effects. Dr. Ning and his colleagues modeled the shallow-emitter effect and its dependence on emitter-contact material. They were also responsible for multiple inventions, including the polysilicon-emitter self-aligned bipolar transistor and the substrate-plate trench-capacitor DRAM cell.\nDr. Ning became the senior manager of the silicon device technology in 1982. Under his leadership, his team contributed to the development of submicron bipolar and CMOS technologies and explored SOI and EEPROM devices. Dr. Ning remained in this position until 1991, the same year he won the IEEE Jack A. Morton Award and became an IBM Fellow.\nSince the early 1990s, much of Dr. Ning's work has been focused on CMOS. In addition to his research, Dr. Ning also represents IBM at the Executive Advisory Board of the Semiconductor Research Corporation. Dr. Ning has served as associate editor of the IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices, is a member of the IEEE Electron Device Society's Administrative Committee, and has served on several conference and IEEE award committees.\nIn addition to receiving the Morton Award, Dr. Ning has also received the 2007 Gordon E. Moore Medal from the Electrochemical Society (2007), the IEEE J.J. Ebers Award (1989), the Pan Wen-Yuan Foundation Outstanding Research Award (1998), and the IEEE Custom Integrated Circuits Conference Best Paper Award (2000). Dr. Ning has authored or co-authored over 120 technical papers and holds 38 U.S. patents.",

        "text": "Collaboration with Gagan Choudhury began in 1992 when he spent a year as an intern in the Mathematics of Networks and Systems Department (headed by Debasis Mitra, where I was) in the Mathematical Sciences Research Center at Bell Labs. As a member of the Network Design and Performance Analysis Department (headed by Pat Wirth), Gagan had already established a strong interest in algorithms and performance analysis tools. Thus Gagan was an ideal person to partner with Joe Abate and me in our efforts to develop numerical transform inversion tools. \nGagan is especially attracted to hard problems. Thus he was attracted to the challenging multidimensional numerical transform inversion problems. Indeed, Gagan wrote almost all the multidimensional inversion code. In doing so, Gagan demonstrated extraordinary algorithm and programming skills as well as mastery of the underlying theory. The basic multidimensional numerical transform inversion algorithms are not so difficult (when the dimension is not large), as can be seen from our 1994 Annals of Applied Probability paper. The real difficulty usually lies in developing special methods to treat specific problems. The challenge, and Gagan's great contribution, can be seen by looking at the 1995 J. ACM paper on closed queueing networks, the 1995 ToN paper on stochastic loss networks with state-dependent rates, the 1996 Performance Evaluation paper on polling systems and the 1997 Operations Research paper on the MtGt/1 queue (all appearing below). The algorithms in those papers go well beyond a direct application of the multidimensional inversion algorithm. \nIn addition to his important direct personal contributions, Gagan also has helped expand the numerical-inversion project by helping to enlist the cooperation of outstanding colleagues from his department such as David Lucantoni and Kin Leung. Gagan also contributed greatly to technology transfer within AT&T by leading the development of the \"Q-squared\" numerical-inversion-based performance analysis tool in his department. ",

        "text": "After graduating with a PhD in electrical engineering from the University of California, Berkeley, in 1969, Charles V. Shank headed to the most successful industrial research institution in the world, the AT&T Bell Laboratories in New Jersey. He spent 20 years there, as both a researcher and director, and his work changed the way scientists see and understand the most fundamental events that shape our world. From there, he went on to play a major role in shaping how scientists approach basic questions about how our world works.\nShank's pioneering research at the Bell Labs introduced the use of short laser pulses to the study of ultrafast events, which take place in a millionth of a billionth of a second. The technique allows researchers to observe atomic motions and interactions with extraordinary time resolution, gaining a better understanding of how energy is stored and transferred within materials. Of particular note was his work in understanding the first step of vision by elucidating the femtochemistry of the molecule rhodopsin.\nIn 1989, Shank moved to the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in Berkeley, California, where he served as director until 2004. The oldest of the Department of Energy's national laboratories, the Berkeley Lab conducts a broad range of research, recently contributing to the development of nanoscience, opening new questions about energy and the universe, and using advanced computing as a tool for scientific discovery. During his 15-year tenure there, Shank oversaw remarkable growth of the lab. Under his direction, the Berkeley Lab emerged as a leader in the field of supercomputing and joined with two other national labs to form the Joint Genome Institute, a major contributor to the decoding of the human genome.\nCharles V. Shank earned his bachelor's, master's, and PhD degrees from the University of California, Berkeley. He directed the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory for 15 years and was a professor of chemistry, physics, and electrical engineering and computer sciences at UC Berkeley.",

        "text": "Rob van Glabbeek has a strong international reputation in the study of the theory of concurrent computation, having made particular contributions to the conciliation of the interleaving and the true concurrency communities by codeveloping the current view of branching time and causality as orthogonal but interacting dimensions of concurrency. He condensed many divergent views on semantic equivalences into the linear time- branching time spectrum. The resulting publications are required reading in the graduate programs of several universities. Together with Peter Weijland he invented the notion of branching bisimulation, that since has become the prototypical example of a branching time equivalence, and the semantic equivalence used in most verification tools based on equivalence checking. With Ursula Goltz he proposed the notion of action refinement as a useful tool for evaluating semantic equivalences and implementation relations. This gave rise to a wave of publications, including a dozen Ph.D. theses. With Peter Rittgen he initiated the application of process algebraic methods in the formal description and analysis of economic production processes. As consultant for Ricoh innovations he contributed to the practical application of concurrency-theoretic ideas in workflow management. With Dominic Hughes he made a crucial contribution to the proof theory of linear logic by proposing a notion of proof net that had been sought after in vain by linear logicians since the inception of linear logic. Together with Vaughan Pratt he initiated the now widespread use of higher dimensional automata and other geometric models of concurrency. With Gordon Plotkin he integrated various causality respecting models of concurrency, including Petri nets, event structures and propositional theories. With Wan Fokkink he used results from unification theory and from modal logic to obtain compositionality results in structural operational semantics. In 2007, in cooperation with Yuxin Deng, Matthew Hennessy, Carroll Morgan and Chenyi Zhang, he characterised the may- and must-testing preorders for processes with probabilistic and nondeterministic choice, thereby solving a problem that was posed in 1992 and has remained open ever since. \n      In addition, he has organised workshops on combining compositionality and concurrency, on logic, language and information, on the Unified Modelling Language, on workflow management, web services and business process modelling, on automatic and semi-automatic system verification, and on structural operational semantics.

        "text": "Camillo Golgi was born in July 1843 in the village of Corteno, in the province of Brescia (Lombardy), Italy. The village is now named Corteno Golgi in his honour. His father was a physician and district medical officer. Golgi studied at the University of Pavia, where he worked in the experimental pathology laboratory under Giulio Bizzozero, who elucidated the properties of bone marrow. He graduated in 1865. He spent much of his career studying the central nervous system. Tissue staining techniques in the later half of the 19th century were inadequate for studying nervous tissue. While working as chief medical officer in a psychiatric hospital, he experimented with metal impregnation of nervous tissue, using mainly silver (silver staining). He discovered a method of staining nervous tissue that would stain a limited number of cells at random in their entirety. This enabled him to view the paths of nerve cells in the brain for the first time. He called his discovery the \"black reaction\" (in Italian, reazione nera), which later received his name (Golgi's method or Golgi stain). The reason for the random staining is still not understood.\nThe black reaction consisted in fixing silver chromate particles to the neurilemma (the neuron membrane) by reacting silver nitrate with potassium dichromate. This resulted in a stark black deposit on the soma as well as on the axon and all dendrites, providing an exceedingly clear and well-contrasted picture of neuron against a yellow background. The ability to visualize separate neurons led to the eventual acceptance of the neuron doctrine.[2] However, Golgi himself was led to a conviction that nervous system is a single network, not of separate cells; the notion called \"reticular theory.\" He supported this discredited theory even in his Nobel lecture.[3][4][5]\nIn addition to this discovery, Golgi discovered a tendon sensory organ that bears his name (Golgi receptor). He studied the life cycle of Plasmodium and related the timing of tertian and quartan fevers seen in malaria with the life cycle of the organisms now named Plasmodium vivax and Plasmodium malariae, respectively.[6] Using his staining technique, Golgi identified the intracellular reticular apparatus in 1898 which bears his name, the Golgi apparatus.\nIn renal physiology Golgi is renowned for being the first to show that the distal tubulus of the nephron returns to its originating glomerulus, a finding that he published in 1889 (\"Annotazioni intorno all'Istologia dei reni dell'uomo e di altri mammifieri e sull'istogenesi dei canalicoli oriniferi\". Rendiconti R. Acad. Lincei 5: 545557, 1889).\nGolgi, together with Santiago Ramn y Cajal, received the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1906 for his studies of the structure of the nervous system. In 1900 he was named senator by King Umberto I.[7] In 1913 he became foreign member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences.[8]\nGolgi was irreligious in his later life and became an agnostic atheist. One of his former students attempted an unsuccessful deathbed conversion on him.[9][10]\nGolgi died in Pavia, Italy, on 21 January 1926.",

        "text": "Themes and areas of research : Quantitative biology and modeling , Cellular dynamics and signaling\nThe assembly of actin filaments is highly regulated in cells, giving rise to various well-controlled architectures (cortex, lamellipodia, filopodia....) and resulting in the specific deformations and movements that are required for many processes (cell motility, cell division, endocytosis, vesicle transport). Actin-binding proteins are key regulators controlling how, where and when actin monomers will assemble into filaments. Understanding their molecular action can be very challenging, especially when multiple activities coexist within a single protein or within a stable complex. In addition, new regulatory effects can emerge from the combined action of several proteins. Our first aim is to decipher these biochemical regulatory activities, at the level of individual reactions.\nMechanics play a central role, as the actin cytoskeleton generates and transmits mechanical forces throughout cells and tissues. Growing evidence shows that the cytoskeleton also senses mechanical forces, and could be directly involved in the conversion of mechanical information into chemical signals. Yet very little is known about the elementary processes of actin mechano-sensitivity. Our goal is to understand how mechanical constraints affect actin dynamics and the action of regulatory proteins.\nIn order to address these questions and unveil the elementary mechanical and chemical processes regulating actin assembly, single filament experiments are essential, in addition to standard biochemical assays. We have developed a microfluidics setup for the observation and manipulation of individual filaments, in combination with different optical microscopy techniques and optical traps. This technique enables us to observe actin filaments while changing their chemical environment, and to apply tensile forces up to a few picoNewtons to these filaments.\nWe are constantly improving this experimental microfluidics-based approach. So far, we have used it to shed light on issues like ATP hydrolysis in filaments, the action of profilin at the barbed end, the occurrence of pauses during filament depolymerization, the synergy between Spire and formin activities at the barbed end, and formin mechano-sensitivity.",

I will remain an adjunct researcher in the Faculty of Information and Communication Technologies at Swinburne University of Technology. My research interest is in software architectural design reasoning. Most software focus on the analysis and design processes but there is very little understanding on how design decisions are made and their influences on systems.  As designers, we assume we make the correct design decisions based on our intuition and experience. The understanding of design decisions and their reasoning will provide much insight into whether decisions are sound and if they can be improved.  I believe that such research will help architects and designers to better design, evaluate, trace and maintain complex systems. I study a number of subjects: (a) design reasoning techniques; (b) methods to capture, represent, use and evaluate design decisions; (c) architecture decision making process; (d) verification of software architecture. I have developed a prototyped tool as part of my on-going work. \nMy other research interest is in designing software for intelligent vehicles. Through AutoCRC support, we have worked with GM Holden to design a remote vehicle monitoring system. Using a remote monitoring system, we can selectively collect vehicle information from ECUs and probe ECUs. I am also interested in studying the use of DSRC to reduce vehicle collisions and improve the safety and efficiency of transport systems. My research involves studying and building intelligent software to detect collision dangers and compute the best way to avoid collisions under different traffic scenarios.\nWorking Experience\nVisiting VU University Amsterdam (2010-)\nSenior Research Fellow / Senior Lecturer at Swinburne University of Technology (2006-2010)\nresearch into software architecture design reasoning \nmanage a R&D team on a AutoCRC/ General Motors Holden project \ndevelop vehicle monitoring systems \nresearch into DSRC-based vehicle collision avoidance software \nPhD Study at Swinburne University of Technology (2004-2006)\nSenior Project Manager at Volante Solutions (2001 - 2004) \nmanage document management and software development projects \nProject Manager at Open Telecommunications (2001) \nproject planning and management of telecommunication software development \nSenior Manager at Tom.Com (2000) \nmanage the architecture and software development, deployment and implementation of a horizontal portal \nSenior Consultant, R&D Manager at AT&T-GIS / NCR (1994-2000) \nproject manage and architect a number of electronic-based and cheque-based payment solutions for central banks and commercial banks \nmanage E-payment R&D team in the Payment Systems Division \nprovide IT consulting services to clients in the Asia Pacific region \nIndependent Senior Consultant (1986-1994) \ndatabase kernel development for Olivetti / AT&T \nfront and back office stockbroking systems development for ANZ McCaughan \ndecision support systems development for Telecom Australia and Hong Kong Telecom \nConsultant at Price Waterhouse (1984-1986) \ndevelop software applications on UNIX and MS platforms \nprovide IT consulting services ",

I then studied neurophysiology and automatic control and worked as a research engineer in a research association called Adersa, headed by Jacques Richalet. During my work I found a thesis subject consisting in looking for stable algorithms for identifying unstable systems. After an unsuccessful \"drop-out\" attempt in the region of Grenoble, I presented a \"doctorat dtat en sciences physiques\" thesis at INPG (1978).\nAt the same time I joined CNRS in Computer Science in Gabrile Saucier's team where I worked on fault-tolerant architectures, in particular with Jacques Pulou who taught me most of my computer science. Here, I met Nicolas Halbwachs and we worked together on formalisms for specifying timed systems. During this work I understood the remarkable adequacy that existed between data-flow concepts and formalisms used in automatic control. This gave me the idea of a programming language which I called LUSTRE (as an acronym for synchronous real-time Lucid). Developed by Nicolas Halbwachs, this language is both an industrial and scientific success and I am quite proud of this. This work and the friendly support of Grard Berry led us to win the Monpetit 2004 prize of the Acadmie des sciences.\nI then spent a lot of time trying to understand what synchrony meant, particularly with Albert Benveniste. Meanwhile, I discovered Philip Wadler's papers on \"listlessness\"and \"deforestation\". I then understood that synchrony was also a mean of efficiently dealing with lazy evaluation in functional programming. This originated my present work with Marc Pouzet.\nIn parallel, thanks to Gabrile Saucier, I was member of the SACEM committee of the French \"Ministre des transports\" who audited the safety computing system of \"RER A\" Paris underground. I worked a lot for this committee and I think I found a good proof for the safety process invented for this system by Philippe Forin from \"Matra-Transport\". Since then I am considered an expert in this field and, for instance, I acted as a scientific advisor for the safety system of the Lyon underground.",

Most people still consider economics to be an observational rather than an experimental science, but that has been changing significantly.\nIn 2007, I joined Yahoo!

Before that, I was a professor of economics at the University of Arizona.

I received a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science from the University of New Brunswick in 1985 and an MsC(CS) from the same University in 1987. While in New Brunswick I worked for the Government of New Brunswick (Data processing division) on a variety of projects, both as a Co-op student and later as a consultant. My master's thesis was entitled \"Perceived Animate Motion by Deterministic Rules of Inter-Object Behaviour\" - it was an early work in what is today called Artificial Life. While writing my MSc thesis I taught university courses in Fortran programming and Interactive Computing.\nFrom 1987 to 1989 I worked at Nortel (then called Bell-Northern Research) in Ottawa, where I designed database applications in the CAD group.\nFrom 1989 to 1994, I worked on my PhD (see below) at the University of Ottawa. This was funded by an NSERC Scholarship as well as consulting contracts (with BNR, and Boeing Aircraft Corporation) and teaching.After defending my thesis, in November 1994, I worked at the University of Ottawa as an Assistant Professor.\nSince 1991, at the University of Ottawa, I have taught courses in Object Orientation, Software Engineering, Software Evolution and User Interfaces. Most of my work until 1997 was with the Institute for Government Informatics Professionals, a program whereby our department upgrades the education of computing professionals.\nMy research has focused on systems to help people manipulate complex information and on software engineering education. I have done research with Mitel Corporation, QNX Corporation and IBM Canada. I have been a full professor since May 2005, and served a term as Acting Associate Dean, starting in January 2005.\nI published the textbook Object Oriented Software Engineering: Practical Software Development Using UML and Java, in its second edition as of 2005. I also was a leader in the development of the Software Engineering 2004 curriculum, sponsored by the IEEE and ACM.\nI have opinions about a number of public issues.\nYou can look at my full curriculum vitae and OCGS format (last 7 years only).

I am also Senior Manager of the User Experience Technologies Department, a role that I took on recently. I have not yet hand a chance to update this page....so the information below is a bit dated. Previously I used to be Senior Manager, Speech Technologies Department which is part of the User Technologies Organization in IBM Research. Ive been in the Speech area at IBM Research since March 1994 working on and leading efforts addressing core speech recognition problems. I was until recently an Associate Editor of the IEEE Transactions in Speech and Audio Processing and a member of the Speech Technical Committee of the IEEE Signal Processing Society.\nResearch activities in my group cover all aspects of speech recognition  signal processing, acoustic modeling, language modeling, search, semantic interpretation, dialog management, post-deployment analysis and tuning, speech self-service diagnostics and audio-visual processing  and occur in the context of several projects. The Telephony Speech Recognition project is aimed at developing algorithms for improving the accuracy & robustness of speech recognition in conversational telephony applications e.g., bank transactions, directory assistance, etc. This project has significant product impact by directly contributing algorithms and data files for WebSphere Voice Server and related voice technology offerings from IBM. The Embedded Speech Recognition project addresses low-resource, robust speech recognition. A significant outgrowth of this ongoing project is ViaVoice for Embedded Multiplatforms, IBM's state-of-the-art speech recognition offering for the PDA, smartphone & automotive environments. Key focus research areas are robust signal processing & efficient search strategies. The Conversational Multimodal Interaction project (managed by Roberto Sicconi) is aimed at developing the next generation dialog management strategies for both embedded (primarily automotive) and server environments by exploiting the latest concepts in UI design and leveraging multiple input and output modalities in a complementary fashion for an unparalleled end-user experience. The Audio-Visual Speech Recognition project addresses the use of visual information for enhanced speech detection and recognition in high-noise environments e.g., moving car.\nLately I have become very interested in research problems in the contact center area. Enterprise contact centers are going through major shifts due to some key business/technology trends: voice-data convergence and the emergence of IP contact centers, migration of contact centers from cost centers to profit centers, customer contact analytics driving business insights beyond contact centers to all functional areas in an enterprise, the growing popularity of hosted contact centers giving small and medium businesses a cost-effective approach to best-of-breed contact centers, offshore outsourcing of contact center operations and infrastructture etc. This opens up several technical challenges with enormous possibilities for research in the areas of multi-channel interaction, self-service, agent performance and customer contact analytics. IBM Research has a large initiative in this area - the Contact Center of the Future Initiative - and I'm a principal in this area at IBM Research. ",

        "text": "With his basic training in aeronautics, mathematics, and fluid physics, Dr. Wu has taught at Caltech since his graduation and pursued research in engineering science, a newly evolving field that forges frontiers abridging engineering with different branches of science. Enjoying teaching, he has been called upon to teach undergraduate core courses and advanced graduate core courses, for which endeavor he was accorded a Caltech Distinguished Teaching Award. He is in full conviction that all students can be inspired, with due stimuli, to learn how to learn best by themselves.\nIn his career, Dr. Wu has shown a broad and versatile interest in research, including flows of compressible, viscous and heat-conducting fluids; free-streamline theory of cavities, jets and wakes; water waves and free-surface flows, mechanics of fish swimming and bird/insect flight; wind and ocean-current energy, internal waves in the ocean, mathematics of nonlinear evolution equatons, etc. With students and visiting colleagues, they collaborated on studies of low-Reynolds-number hydrodynamics, microorganism locomotion and related biophysical phenomena. The recent research interest of Wu's group is focused on forced generation of nonlinear waves at resonance of soliton-bearing systems, three-dimensional vortex dynamics, and coastal oceanography. His new theoretical model for fully nonlinear dispersive waves in water of variable depth is ideal for investigating mitigation and control of such natural hazards as tsunami, storm surge, and hurricanes. The new idea and concept, based on devising means for active and passive control and mitigation of devastating waves and fluid flows, may germinate growth of a new field. Revisiting bio-physics, he has developed a fully nonlinear lifting theory for modeling bird flying and fish swimming. In collection, Dr. Wu has authored and co-authored over 150 papers published in archive journals and book chapters. His lifetime contributions have been recognized by winning the Lifetime Achievement Awards of the 1993 Chinese-American Faculty Assoc. of So. Calif., 1995 Chinese Engineers and Scientists Association of So. Calif., and of the 2000 No. American Chiao Tung U. Alumni Assoc.",

        "text": "We are currently carrying out two lines of translation-oriented research using clinically relevant mouse models, aiming to restore motor and sensory functions after peripheral nerve injury or spinal cord root injury. Although it is commonly believed that the peripheral nerve regenerates, recovery from human nerve injuries typically takes months to years, and is incomplete in >90% of cases. The poor functional recovery in humans is primarily because peripheral axons fail to regenerate over long-distances. Moreover, injuries in dorsal root sensory nerves almost certainly lead to the loss of sensation, because sensory axons fail to regenerate into spinal cord. In the first line of research, we aim to promote long-distance regeneration and enable regenerating nerves to reach peripheral targets such as muscles. Our approach is to prevent or reverse the atrophy of Schwann cells, which lose the ability to support axon regeneration over time after injury. For the second line of research, we are studying a novel mechanism that prevent regeneration of sensory nerve into spinal cord, while developing unprecedently-effective and translatable treatments to enable robust, long and target-specific regeneration of sensory axons within the spinal cord. Our laboratory is among the few that study regeneration of peripheral nerves both peripherally and centrally. We represent the only group capable of applying in vivo time-lapse imaging in studying dorsal root regeneration. In addition, the techniques that our group utilizes, such as wide-field and multiphoton in vivo imaging, inducible/conditional transgenic mice, virus-mediated in vivo transduction, and tissue-clearing such as CLARITY are rarely used in the study of dorsal root or peripheral nerve regeneration. Importantly, we use combinations of these methods in novel ways to correlate in vivo imaging with light and ultrastructural analyses and elucidate critically important issues that previous static analyses could not decipher. We hope that our work will lead to novel therapeutic strategies to promote repair of spinal cord-muscle connections in patients with neuromuscular, spinal cord or spinal root injury.",

His father, Riccardo, an engineer who worked for the telephone company, became the chief engineer of the city of Genoa when the phone company merged with their French counterpart. Salvadori's father later became the head of the gas and electric company in Spain. His mother, Ermelinda Alatri, belonged to a rich Jewish family. Following his father's activities, Salvadori spent many years of his youth in Madrid and only returned to Italy in 1923. Two years later, when he was 18, he started what the first student jazz band in Italy; one of his youthful dreams was to become a concert conductor, although his parents did not encourage this.[1] He was also a skillful mountain climber; he found several new climbing routes on Dolomites.[2]\nHe earned doctoral degrees in both civil engineering and mathematics from the University of Rome in 1930 and 1933, respectively. Then he served as an instructor at Engineering department of the University of Rome and as consultant for Istituto per le Applicazioni del Calcolo (INAC), directed by Mauro Picone, his mathematics teacher. Thanks to a grant, he went to London and in the next two years he did graduate research in photoelasticity at University College London, where he was in contact with Jews escaping from Nazi persecutions. Subsequently, when he returned to Rome, Salvadori was a convinced critic of the regime of Benito Mussolini,[1] and was aware of the risks for his mother's family. In 1939, when Mussolini promulgated the Italian Racial Laws, Salvadori left Italy[1] with his wife, who was also Jewish. At the same time he tried, with poor results, to convince his relatives to follow his example.\nIt was difficult to leave Italy but in late 1938, he received a grant to study the first television experiments in the United States  his teacher and friend Enrico Fermi was an influential member of the examining commission. The grant allowed Salvadori and his wife to get a six months visa. While in the U.S., Salvadori stored some goods in a safe deposit box and left the key with Raymond D. Mindlin, whom he had met in New York a few months before, after a conference about the activities of Picone's institute.[3] When he returned to Italy, he saw that there was no hope for a positive change in the political environment. The University of Rome and Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (CNR) stripped him of his positions. After this, he and his wife left Italy for good, using the same visa. On the same day he arrived in New York, the CNR restored him as a consultant to INAC, thanks to the influence of Picone.",

The recipient is selected by a panel of judges consisting of Honeywell management and non-Honeywell consultants. \nSubsequently while on the CMU CS faculty (see below), he contributed as a consultant to the world's second distributed computer control system commercial product, the Westinghouse DPS. \nDoug's principal interest is conducting applied research, advanced technology development, and technology transfer -- especially in (but not limited to) the field of dynamic, adaptive, time-critical distributed systems for control applications at all levels of an enterprise. \nDoug is currently a Consulting Engineer reporting to the Executive Director of the Innovation and Technology Directorate, of the Command and Control Center, in the DoD FFRDC, at the MITRE Corporation's Bedford, MA headquarters. \nHe and his academic collaborating co-authors have published over 120 papers on results from his 2003-2008 research project in high quality IEEE and ACM conference proceedings and journals. Most of his technology transition work is classified. \nDoug came to MITRE in 1998 from senior research and technology leadership positions at Hewlett Packard and Digital Equipment Corp. where he led development of commercial distributed real-time products. \nPrior to that, he was on the faculty of the Computer Science Department at Carnegie Mellon University. There he created and led the largest real-time research group of its time, sponsored by all of the DoD services, DARPA, and numerous corporations. \nOne of his group's major achievements was the uniquely innovative Alpha distributed real-time operating system kernel. Keystone concepts and technologies from Alpha -- notably time/utility function time constraints, utility accrual scheduling optimality criteria, and distributed threads -- have subsequently been incorporated in the OMG Real-Time CORBA specification. Those have also been implemented in the MITRE Distributed Real-Time Java, which is being proposed for Sun's Distributed Real-Time Specification for Java. They have also been implemented in MITRE experimental BM/C2 projects, and in several COTS operating systems, and in research projects at various universities. \nBefore being invited to join the CMU CS faculty, he was employed in the real-time computer industry, where he engaged in research and advanced technology development of distributed real-time computer systems, hardware, and software for the defense and industrial automation domains.",

        "text": "Research interests and expertise:\nI am a soil microbiologist and agronomist with more than 35 years of experience on aspects of sustainable management of agriculture and natural resources for increasing food security and environmental quality. Throughout my career, a topic that has continually attracted my attention and interest is nitrogen, an intriguing enigma. Nitrogens good side is that the nutrient is required for crop production. However, the elements bad side is that excess amounts not used by plants go either into the groundwater as nitrate, or the atmosphere as nitrogen oxide, which can cause serious human and animal health problems and air pollution. The challenge is to optimize nitrogen (N) use while minimizing its negative impacts. We have been encouraging farmers to efficiently apply N fertilizer only when the crop requires it.\nOne of the most exciting projects for me at IRRI was working in the 1990s on the international initiative to investigate the feasibility of developing cereals, such as rice, that could fix biological nitrogen like legumes do. We discovered that rice possesses a genetic mechanism for nodulation, as in legumes. Recently, we developed global N budgets for the three globally important cereals  maize, rice and wheat. I have also been interested in long-term experiments  analyzed trends of crop productivity and soil N and carbon (C) stocks in more than 100 experiments running throughout world.\nRecently, I analyzed IRRIs Long-Term Continuous Cropping Experiment (LTCCE), one of the worlds longest-running agricultural trials. In the experiment, we have watched rice yields decline starting in 1968 all the way through to 2015. We concluded that growing three rice crops in a year is too intensive to be sustainable in the long-term unless the relationships between varieties and agronomy are addressed. During the last two decades, I have been working on conservation agriculture in South Asia. I led the Cereal System Initiative System for South Asia and the Rice-Wheat Consortium Project that aims to sustainably enhance crop productivity and environmental quality. Following a holistic, systems approach, covering various components of agronomic, soil and water management, we developed innovative resource-use-efficient alternatives of tillage/crop establishment strategies.",

In addition, a major theme is the influence of mitochondrial signaling and dynamics on skeletal muscle development, function, regeneration, and health. \nThe specific areas of focus of the Skeletal Muscle Biology & Cell Death Laboratory currently are:\nAutophagic and Mitophagic Signaling in Skeletal Muscle\nAutophagy is a cellular degradation mechanism that aids in the removal of cytoplasmic contents such as macromolecules and organelles, thereby influencing cell survival. It is now well established that dysregulation of apoptotic and autophagic signaling play major roles in tissue dysfunction and in the pathogenesis of numerous diseases. The Skeletal Muscle Biology & Cell Death Laboratory is at the forefront of understand the role of autophagy and mitophagy (a specialized form of mitochondrial autophagy) in the formation and maintenance of skeletal muscle. We recently discovered that autophagy is required for skeletal muscle differentiation.\nApoptotic Signaling in Skeletal Muscle\nApoptosis is a highly conserved cell death mechanism that allows multi-cellular organisms to maintain tissue and cellular homeostasis. The Skeletal Muscle Biology & Cell Death Laboratory is defining some of the important differences in apoptotic signaling and susceptibility between muscles, fiber types, and mitochondria. We are also investigating the critical role of oxidative stress and mitochondrial content/function on apoptotic susceptibility, and defining key apoptotic signaling aspects that are essential in skeletal muscle differentiation and formation.\nInterplay between Autophagy and Apoptosis during Cell Death and Myogenesis\nThe Skeletal Muscle Biology & Cell Death Laboratory is investigating the interplay between autophagic and apoptotic signaling in skeletal muscle. Recently, our lab discovered that autophagy regulates caspase activation and degrades damaged and dysfunctional mitochondria (mitophagy) thereby protecting skeletal muscle cells from cell death and allowing for optimal muscle formation.\nRole of Mitochondrial Dynamics on Skeletal Muscle Regeneration and Myogenesis\nAlong with mitophagy, mitochondrial biogenesis is important in mitochondrial dynamics by increasing overall mitochondrial content and mass. In addition, mitochondrial fission and fusion regulate the specific nature of the mitochondrial network. The Skeletal Muscle Biology & Cell Death Laboratory has found that induction of mitochondrial biogenesis and regulation of mitochondrial fission and fusion are critical in proper skeletal muscle formation by influencing apoptotic and autophagic signaling.\nEffect of Physical Activity and Diet on Apoptotic and Autophagic Signaling\nIt is well known that exercise and diet are important in the management and prevention of numerous diseases. Exercise and nutrition influence a number of intracellular signaling pathways. Work from the Skeletal Muscle Biology & Cell Death Laboratory has found that exercise and models that mimic exercise signaling in vitro can alter apoptosis and autophagy in skeletal muscle. New work from our lab is demonstrating the benefits of acute nutritional interventions on skeletal muscle autophagic signaling during skeletal muscle damage and regeneration.\nTeaching, expertise, tools and technologies\nSkeletal muscle biology\nSkeletal muscle disease\nExercise physiology\nMitochondria\nCell and molecular biology\nMicroscopy\nCell culture\nAnimal models\nCellular imaging",

        "text": "RESEARCH INTERESTS\nSpace-time analogies in electromagnetics: There is an intriguing analogy between the equations that describe the natural diffraction of electromagnetic wave in space and the spreading or dispersion of electromagnetic pulses in dielectrics. The mathematical analogy between these equations has led our group to develop the time domain analog of spatial lenses. These so-called time lenses allow us to manipulate optical waveforms in the time domain in much the same way that spatial imaging with conventional lenses is performed. For example, we have recently demonstrated a time microscope which can expand optical pulse trains by a factor of 100 which makes subpicosecond phenomena observable on a commercial high-speed oscilloscope. This technique may someday find applications in pushing the data rate of high speed fiber optic elecommunications systems.\nTerahertz spectroscopy: Far above the frequency range of microwave signals is a portion of the spectrum where electromagnetic waves interact with complex molecules. This region, from roughly 100 Ghz to 100 THz, is difficult to access with conventional technology but recent advances using femtosecond light pulses has made it available for study in the laboratory and even on a small commercial scale. Briefly, intense femtosecond light pulses in the visible portion of the spectrum are focused into crystals, which react strongly with the intense optical field and reradiate pulses in the terahertz region with equally short duration and hence very large bandwidths. In effect, the process instantaneously covers a large portion of the spectrum in a very short electromagnetic pulse. We are creating systems to generate and detect these pulses and use them to study the interaction of the radiation with various materials. Generically, this is called spectroscopy and we are interested in the vast region of frequencies between microwaves and the near infrared.\nLasers as clocks: Modern femtosecond pulsed lasers have demonstrated extraordinary stability in the repetition rate of the pulse train. These lasers typically generate pulses of 20 femtoseconds at rates around 100 MHz. If the repetition rate were absolutely constant, these lasers could act as clocks by turning the optical pulses into electrical pulses with phodetectors. However, like any real oscillator (electrical, mechanical, optical, atomic), the repetition rate fluctuates and this deviation from the ideal is known as phase noise. We have assembled a system for studying the phase noise of femtosecond lasers that is quite possibly the best in the world in the sense that it can detect the most minute fluctuations in the timing stability right down to the quantum limit. We have recently used this system to characterize the stability of several optical and electronic oscillators and have found that our femtosecond lasers have remarkably low phase noise, even rivaling the best electronic oscillators. This suggests that femtosecond lasers, with further development, might make practical alternatives to quartz electronic oscillators for special applications in frequency and time keeping metrology.",

        "text": "Dr. Feigenbaum is a pioneer in the science of chaos, the mathematics of erratic dynamical systemsobjects with unpredictable behavior and an attendant fractal geometry.\nChaotic motion shows a lack of predictability despite the total absence of any random ingredients. While the various constraints on a system, such as bounded resources, can allow it to move regularly on a smooth space, its chaotic motion lies in a highly complicated subspacea so-called strange attractor. Using computers and inventing mathematics, Dr. Feigenbaum erected a full, precise mathematical description of systems during their transition from order to disorderfor example, a dripping faucet changing from a steady drip into an erratic one. The mathematics that underlies this changeover holds true for all systems undergoing this period doubling onset of chaos, with all scaling details identically independent of a systems precise nature, including fluctuating animal populations, electrical signals in circuits, lasers, and various chemical reactions. Dr. Feigenbaum has shown that all these phenomena prominently exhibit numbers determined by his theory, for example 4.6692016, a constant of nature called Feigenbaums constant, determining the rate of onset.\nA fractal is a complex object built hierarchically of finer and finer details, all similar apart from their successively reduced scales. These intricate formations in space, reminiscent of objects such as mountains and snowflakes, as well as complex formations in time, can be described by mathematical rules, discovered by Dr. Feigenbaum, called scaling functions. Scaling functions describe the evolution of an object, whatever its current form or size, and so, unchanged, can be repeatedly reapplied.\nIn this circumstance, the object produced is scale invariant, meaning that as it evolves from a given size, its details remain loosely proportional to that size, and so, fractal. Looking at systems from this perspective, Dr. Feigenbaum has made important contributions to numerous fields, including cartography: As a consultant to the Hammond Corporation, he developed techniques that allow computers to draw maps of archival quality, with unprecedented accuracy, using a dataset of just one high, fixed resolution. This atlas, published in 1992, contains Dr. Feigenbaums optimal conformal projections for arbitrarily chosen regions on Earth, and these projections are at least three times more accurate than all previous ones. The computer-automated labeling of maps was also accomplished by a new directed-annealing algorithm for dynamical systems.\nDuring his time at Rockefeller, Dr. Feigenbaum has taken part in numerous collaborations, including research into the electrical fluctuations of single neurons to quantitatively determine their chaotic properties; measuring the way fibroblasts travel to the site of injury, observing that as their path appears not to be random, they are moving chaotically; and analyses of the outcome of optical imaging of cortical activity.",

He shared the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1968 (with Har Gobind Khorana and Marshall Warren Nirenberg) for describing the structure of alanine transfer RNA, linking DNA and protein synthesis.\nHolley was born in Urbana, Illinois, and graduated from Urbana High School in 1938. He went on to study chemistry at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, graduating in 1942 and commencing his PhD studies in organic chemistry at Cornell University. During World War II Holley spent two years working under Professor Vincent du Vigneaud at Cornell University Medical College, where he was involved in the first chemical synthesis of penicillin. Holley completed his PhD studies in 1947.*USDA ARS.[1][2][3]\nFollowing his graduate studies Holley remained associated with Cornell. He became an Assistant Professor of organic chemistry in 1948, and was appointed as Professor of Biochemistry in 1962. He began his research on RNA after spending a year's sabbatical (19551956) studying with James F. Bonner at the California Institute of Technology.\nHolley's research on RNA focused first on isolating transfer RNA (tRNA), and later on determining the sequence and structure of alanine tRNA, the molecule that incorporates the amino acid alanine into proteins. Holley's team of researchers determined the tRNA's structure by using two ribonucleases to split the tRNA molecule into pieces. Each enzyme split the molecule at location points for specific nucleotides. By a process of \"puzzling out\" the structure of the pieces split by the two different enzymes, then comparing the pieces from both enzyme splits, the team eventually determined the entire structure of the molecule.\nThe structure was completed in 1964,[4][5] and was a key discovery in explaining the synthesis of proteins from messenger RNA. It was also the first nucleotide sequence of a ribonucleic acid ever determined. Holley was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1968 for this discovery,[6] and Har Gobind Khorana and Marshall W. Nirenberg were also awarded the prize that year for contributions to the understanding of protein synthesis.\nUsing the Holley team's method, other scientists determined the structures of the remaining tRNA's. A few years later the method was modified to help track the sequence of nucleotides in various bacterial, plant, and human viruses.\nIn 1968 Holley became a resident fellow at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies in La Jolla, California.",

He worked on mRNA sequencing and discovered the AAUAAA poly(A) signal as a graduate student with George Brownlee [1]. As a postdoctoral fellow at LMB, he began a study to clone and sequence globin genes [2]. This led him in 1979 to take a postdoc position in the USA with Tom Maniatis where he cloned and sequenced various globin genes, discovering globin pseudogenes and structural details about the evolution of the  and  globin gene families in man [3,4]. Nick started his lab at the Sir William Dunn School of Pathology, University of Oxford in 1981 as a Lecturer and then Professor. He was also a Fellow and Tutor in Biochemistry at Brasenose College from 1982-2003. His research initially focused on poly(A) signals, their genetics and biology. From these studies his lab discovered that mRNA processing is coupled to transcription [5,6] which led into detailed analysis of the mechanism and biological significance of transcriptional termination. In particular, they uncovered the molecular process of transcriptional interference [7,10,13], and characterized signals and factors that mediate transcriptional termination of RNA polymerases I and II in yeast and mammals [9,11,12,15-17]. They also discovered the existence of transcription dependent gene loops associated with all tested eukaryotic genes [14] and more recently demonstrated that these structures function to provide transcription directionality [22]. They were the first lab to discover intergenic transcription in a mammalian gene locus [8] and also uncovered similar intergenic transcription in S. pombe that leads to cell cycle specific heterochromatin formation and cohesin recruitment [18]. Further studies led to the characterisation of pre-micro RNA co-transcriptional maturation by DROSHA [19,24] as well as establishing the role of helicases (Sen1 and SENATAXIN) in restricting R-loop formation in yeast and mammals [20,21,23]. Most recently they have expanded their studies to investigate the extent of transcription across the human genome using various transcriptomic analyses. This has led to a genomic perspective of how transcription and RNA processing are coupled mechanisms [25,26]. During 35 years at Oxford Nick has had the satisfaction of seeing his research field expand from a relatively small focus into an interconnecting series of topics widely considered to be central to gene expression. He has co-organized from the late 1980s, seven four-yearly spaced workshops at Oxford on Eukaryotic RNA 3 ends: formation and function. These have provided a major forum for the field as it has developed over the last 40 years.",

        "text": "Research\nPhysics and chemistry of clouds: Visualization, laboratory, and field experiments\nClouds are complex systems within the atmosphere which interconnect suspended objects of very different nature through highly delicate microphysical and chemical processes. Detailed knowledge and -in particular- the capability for adequate mathematical representation are essential for the numerical simulation of clouds, and realistic forecasts of precipitation and weather, as well as for studies of cloud effects on climate. To obtain useful parameterizations for the various processes laboratory experiments still are key tools. Examples are the characterization of the collision-coalescence process underlying warm-rain formation, and experiments on the freezing of cloud/rain drops. Other experiments are dedicated to the investigation of the chemical retention process of soluble trace gases during riming on small ice spheres and onto snowflakes. Retention here means the carry over of these substances from the initial liquid solution of the polluted, riming, supercooled droplets onto the frozen hydrometeors. Some of the materials are returned back to the gas phase and lost from the hydrometeors- during the freezing process. The amounts of this retention influence the vertical distribution of the trace gases inside the large convective clouds as well as their export through the anvil outflows at high altitudes. This is of relevance for example in the context of the Asian Monsoon Anticyclone where large amounts of trace materials are transported from the boundary layer to high altitudes by deep convective clouds.\nSince 30 years the Mainz Vertical Wind Tunnel facility is operational for experiments in this research field. After the extending the facility for performing experiments down to -30 C processes relevant for so-called \"mixed phase clouds\" (where glaciated cloud particles coexist with supercooled liquid droplets) can be simulated. At first in the presentation several cloud physical processes (like rain formation, freezing, and riming) demonstrated by means of high speed camera video clips. Then an overview of several experimental results is provided together with a discussion of their significance.",

        "text": "My research interests fall broadly within the disciplines of ecosystem ecology, applied forest ecology, and sustainable agriculture, while encompassing aspects of plant ecophysiology, restoration ecology, ecohydrology, and sustainability science. The overarching question that I seek to address through my research is: What are the key ecological processes that determine an ecosystems capacity to sustainably provide diverse benefits to society while maintaining resilience to change, and how can these processes be actively reinforced and strengthened through management? I am particularly interested in the effects of climate change and land use change on the water cycle, and the linkages between plant-water interactions and nutrient and carbon cycles, in both forest and agricultural systems. An important component of my research program involves transferring information about ecological processes across scalesfrom the individual leaf or whole tree to the ecosystem, watershed, and landscape. I utilize a variety of approaches and tools to address this question, including stable isotopes of carbon, oxygen, and hydrogen, plant ecophysiological measurements, long-term monitoring of ecosystem processes, micrometeorology, and modeling. Currently active research projects in my lab include: I currently maintain four primary research projects in my lab. The first involves understanding the ecohydrological impacts, feedbacks, and interactions between climate change, land use, and water-carbon-nutrient cycling in forest ecosystems in the northeastern US and at regional scales. The second project is examining the biophysical and socioeconomic implications of increasing the production of food, biofuel, and fiber in New England and the potential for balancing the provisioning of multiple ecosystem service with maintaining the resilience and stability of ecosystems to environmental change. My international research focuses on the ecohydrological impacts of land use and climate change in diverse ecosystems (e.g., montane cloud forests, dry deciduous forests), and assessing the implications for policies such as payments for ecosystem services. Lastly, I am involved in long-term watershed scale research in the Corn Belt region of the Midwestern US to assess the potential for improving water quality, hydrologic regulation, and other ecosystem services by integrating small amounts of perennial vegetation in strategic locations within rowcrop agriculture.",

BALZHISER, energy technology leader and former CEO of the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI), died on December 23, 2012, at the age of 80 after a long battle with Alzheimers disease.\nDick was born and raised in Wheaton, Illinois, where he was an outstanding student and a star athlete at Wheaton High School. He continued to excel in both the classroom and on the football field at the University of Michigan, where he received BS and PhD degrees in chemical engineering and an MS in nuclear engineering. In 1952 he became the universitys first football player to earn first-team academic all-American honors, and two years later he was awarded the Big Ten Medal of Honor for his accomplishments in the classroom and on the football field. A brilliant and ambitious student, Dick graduated at the top of his engineering class.\nMotivated by both a desire to give back to the university and an interest in public service, Dick joined the Michigan University Chemical Engineering Department in 1961 and became chair in 1970. He was also twice elected to the Ann Arbor City Council and was named an outstanding young leader in the state of Michigan. In 1967, he was selected as a White House Fellow; he served as an assistant to Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara and participated in a number of important assignments, including a comprehensive assessment of the nations commitment to the Vietnam War that came to be known as the Pentagon Papers.\nFrom 1971 to 1973 Dick was assistant director in the White House Office of Science and Technology, responsible for energy, environment, and natural resources. Under President Nixon, he directed a comprehensive study of energy technology following the first Energy Message. His leadership of these early deliberations led to the creation of the Federal Energy Administration, the Energy Research and Development Administration, and, later, the Department of Energy. He also chaired the US Energy Technology Committee that opened relations with the USSR in 19721973.\nWhile serving in the Office of Science and Technology, Dick met Chauncey Starr, the commercial nuclear technology innovation leader who answered the call from Congress to create EPRI, an independent research and development organization, in 1972. Dick was very inspired by Dr. Starr, EPRIs first president, and the challenges and opportunities that the institute presented as the nonprofit public service organization managing a $500+ million/year collaborative research and development program on behalf of electric utilities nationwide and around the world.",

        "text": "After graduating in 1947 from Cornell University Medical College Dr. Clements joined its Physiology Department as a research fellow and instructor. Two years later, when a shortage of military doctors became acute, he volunteered for service and was assigned to the United States Army Medical Research Laboratory at Edgewood, Maryland. As a part of his duties there he developed an interest in pulmonary function and began to elucidate the physical and chemical properties of a previously unknown material he named lung surfactant which was later found to be essential to normal breathing. This application of biochemical knowledge to respiratory mechanics was an unlikely, pioneering step, and for several years physiologists and physicians largely ignored it. Dr. Clements education had been unusual, however, in that he had a special interest in chemistry and as an undergraduate had taken courses in the chemical engineering curriculum rather than the introductory pre-medical chemistry courses. Also, he had a colleague and friend at the Edgewood laboratories who was an expert on protein films at water surfaces and who taught him rudiments of surface phenomena.  Dr. Clements manuscript describing the surfactant was rejected by Science magazine in 1956 but, a year later, appeared in an un-reviewed journal. The Institute of Scientific Information later found that this was among the most cited papers in the medical literature. It was only after several years of research that the mysterious surfactant was proven to be a lipid-protein complex that could lower surface tension dramatically and thereby prevent the airspaces of the lungs from collapsing. Before that, in 1958, he had discussed the importance of the surfactant in maintaining expansion of the airspaces, and also his methods of demonstrating the surfactant, with Avery and Mead of Harvard University. In 1959 they reported that the surfactant was missing from the lungs of infants who had died with respiratory distress syndrome (RDS). This seminal finding proved the clinical relevance of the surfactant and entrained the interest of many researchers. The ensuing growth of surfactant studies opened the door to the science of pulmonary biology.",

He spent 30 years at Harvard Medical School, where he was faculty dean for clinical affairs and still holds the title of Henry Isaiah Dorr Professor of Research and Teaching in Anesthesia and Anesthetics, Emeritus. Previously, he was co-director of the HarvardMIT Division of Health Sciences and Technology, chair of the Anesthesiology Department at Massachusetts General Hospital, and associate professor for Columbia Universitys College of Physicians and Surgeons. He also served as a medical officer for the U.S. Navy and was assigned to the Marine Corps in Japan in 195556.\nNaturally humble, Richard says his personal formula for success is simple: Assuming the qualities of integrity, education/intelligence, interest in helping others and hard work, then the key is to be nice, nicer, the nicest!\nIn addition to his reputation as a genuinely nice guy, Richard is also internationally known for his research in the anesthesiology field, and his achievements include five patents; 50 original reports; and more than 30 reviews, book chapters and editorials. Equally important, his impact on the academic medical field lives on in his former students, more than 70 of whom went on to lead departments around the world.\nAlthough Richard is now retired, his passion for helping the next generation of students continues today at Marquette, where he established the Dr. Richard Kitz Endowed Scholarship Fund and Dr. Richard Kitz Athletic Scholarship Fund. He is thankful to Marquette for inculcating the values and attitudes essential to a life of helping others, he says.\nThe Marquette mission also infused his ethical, thoughtful approach to leadership.\nWhen you think about being chief of a huge anesthesia service, responsible for peoples careers, youre making decisions all the time, he told the Medical College of Wisconsin after he was named Alumnus of the Year by the Medical College of Wisconsin/Marquette Medical Alumni Association in 2009. I learned how to make the right decisions at Marquette  how to look at questions, make hypotheses, test hypotheses, look at data to see if hypotheses are supported or not. Those habits have stayed with me.\nAlthough his career took him in a different direction than he initially planned, he has no regrets. As he told a Harvard publication when he was first appointed as faculty dean for clinical affairs, My dad always said, If you do something, do something important.",

        "text": "Much of my work concerns the historical sociology of state formation. My doctoral work criticized Marxist reproduction analyses of the development of public education through comparative historical investigation. Involvement in the debate around domestic labour under capitalism, led me to think about the historical sociology of household formation and the relations between the domestic domain and the political. Historians criticized my early historical sociology as based on secondary sources (their own work!), which led me to the archive, and which gave me an enduring case of what Arlette Farge called le gout de larchive. My understanding of state paper collections was shaped by engagement with the Foucault wave, with the work of Norbert Elias, and by Corrigan and Sayers analysis of state formation as cultural revolution. Together with the sociology of Marx, Simmel and Bourdieu, this mix encouraged attention to the emergence, stabilization, and dominance or disappearance of social forms, figurations, and practices. My most marked post-2000 reading experiences have been with Kant, Gadamer, the proto-sociology of the Enlightenment, French political theory, and the historical sociology of Arpad Szakolczai.\nI have always been fascinated by the counter-intuitive, by what doesnt fit, by problematic instances of what Pierre Bourdieu called category slippage (which he saw as the sociologists bread and butter) and by the development of systems of classification and categorization. This has led to work, influenced by social studies of science and actor-network theory, on the history of weights and measures; the making of the census and of census categories; the politics of demography; and cases of boundary crossing, from so-called blues singers changing their names to record gospel music, to the configuration of modern consumers by new information technologies, and the age-governance of sexuality. The same interest is present in work I have done in the historical sociology of the governmental instrument of inspection, on sanitary medicine, the nineteenth century cholera, and attempts to construct systems of civil registration and vital statistics. I also do work on power and sexuality, historically in terms of the government of sex at school, in the current period in relation to the fellatio epidemic in middle school. I am interested in promoting a reflexive sociology that interrogates the analytic categories it employs.\nI continue to work on a number of spin-offs from my most recent book, Ruling by Schooling Quebec, including issues of pastoral power, of proto-sociology and state administration and the nature and effects of the tithe. My long-term research focuses on the historical sociology of blues music, especially in the period to 1940. I have a longstanding interest in many dimensions of this field, from the technical dimensions of musical production, reproduction, and consumption, to the discourses offered by typically subaltern voices. I wish in particular to reclaim the category of the ribald, which has largely been expurgated from this field of cultural production.",

Upon completion of his medical training at the University of Pavia in 1974, he received specialty training in Hematology and Nephrology at the University of Milan. Since 1975, he has pursued his academic career at the Bergamo hospital, where he was appointed Professor of Nephrology and Director of both the Department of Immunology and Clinical Transplantation (1996) and the Department of Medicine in 2011. Since 1999, he is Director of the Division of Nephrology and Dialysis of the same hospital. Since 1984 he also coordinates the Negri Bergamo Laboratories of the Mario Negri Institute for Pharmacological Research and the affiliated Clinical Research Center for Rare Diseases Aldo e Cele Dacc in Ranica (BG), a group of basic scientists, physiologists, pharmacologists, molecular and cellular biologists, pathologists and clinicians devoted to the study of human renal diseases and their corresponding animal models from the perspective of pathophysiology and therapeutic intervention. He touched major advances in many areas of nephrology. For example, his studies have led to new insights into many disorders, including the interactions between platelets and endothelium, pathophysiology of glomerular diseases and the factors that influence the progressive loss of kidney function. Work focused on improving the outlook for patients with end stage renal disease. Giuseppe Remuzzi pays tribute to the work of pioneers such as Barry Brenner, who delved deep into the processes behind glomerular function and their possible reversibility. Early work on the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors to slow the decline of glomerular filtration rates proved dialysis was avoidable, not inevitable. Studies on immunologic mechanisms that influence the survival of transplanted organs, understanding of immunologic tolerance in the disorders that are linked to autoimmunity and finally, genetic diseases of the kidney have also been areas of investigation. Concerned by kidney donation shortages and deploring the current practice of discarding suboptimal donor kidneys, his team has shown that transplanting such kidneys in pairs is feasible and have set up an international effort to validate this approach. Giuseppe Remuzzi is investigating the kidney's ability to regenerate itself.",

He transferred to the Advanced Technology group in San Jose, CA in 1965 where he was involved in contributing to and managing several ground-breaking data storage technology programs such as IBM's film heads for hard disk drives and several types of optical storage technologies. He was a founder of IBM's Magnetic Recording Institute (MRI) and was its first director in 1982. In 1983, he was appointed IBM Fellow He was born in England, grew up and went to high school in The Midlands during World War II. At the end of the war he went to Nottingham University to study Physics. He had been accepted at Cambridge, but was pre-empted by returning service men since they had priority. It worked out well because Nottingham was one of three universities that specialized in magnetism, and he stayed at Nottingham until 1951 where he was able to do his thesis on the magnetic properties of ferromagnetic materials. This bode well for his later career. He received a London Bachelor's degree of Physics, but then when he started the PhD, Nottingham became a university so he was granted a Nottingham Ph.D.; one of the first Nottingham Ph.D.s in that school. In 1954, before coming before going to the U.S. (1957), he worked for MSS Recording Company, in London that was in the process of developing magnetic tape for data storage. This was his first encounter with the computer industry, and it was a government project to upgrade magnetic tape, which was mostly used for audio recording. IBM, at that time, had just developed a 1/2-inch tape drive, and 3M supplied the tapes for IBM. His job was on a British government-sponsored project. Among the books he has authored, co-authored or edited are: Physics of Magnetic Recording, North Holland Pub. Co. (1964); with Eric Daniel, Magnetic Recording (3 volumes), McGraw-Hill (1987); and \"Magnetic Recording: The First 100 Years\", edited with Eric D. Daniel and Mark H.

This will help us to control the properties of metals that we use in our everyday lives and to design new, improved metallic materials.\nMost of the metallic materials on which we rely are polycrystals. They are made up of many grains in which the atoms are arranged in ordered patterns. The orientation of these patterns varies from one grain to the next and the surfaces between pairs of grains are known as grain boundaries.\nThe pattern of grain boundaries in a metal, its \"grain structure\", strongly affects the metal's behaviour, changing how it deforms, corrodes and cracks. If we can control the grain structure then we can control the metal's properties. We obtain a desired grain structure by subjecting a metal to mechanical processes and heat treatments, which make the grain boundaries move around. So controlling the grain structure requires the control of grain boundary migration.\nMy work uses computer simulations to understand why materials behave the way that they do. I have previously found that even simple grain boundaries move in different and complicated ways depending on conditions such as the temperature and how hard we push them to move. To predict the evolution of grain structures we need to approach the problem from the atomistic length-scale upwards. My proposed research will uncover the links between the shuffling of the individual atoms of metals with the evolution of their grain structure and so with their changing properties on the scale of our everyday lives. It starts at the level of fundamental physical laws (quantum mechanics, Newtonian dynamics) and produces results that matter to us all.\nIf we can understand how grain boundaries move then we can produce better metallic materials. That means stronger, lighter, cheaper, safer materials, with all the benefits to society that that implies.",

She is the recipient of the American Political Science Association's 2015 Leo Strauss Award for the best doctoral dissertation in political philosophy. In 2016, she was elected as the final Balzan-Skinner Fellow in Modern Intellectual History at the University of Cambridge. Her keynote lecture, 'Acknowledging Equality,' can be viewed here.\nDr Bejan's research brings perspectives from early modern English and American political thought to bear on questions in contemporary political theory and practice.  She has published peer-reviewed articles in The Journal of Politics, History of Political Thought, Review of Politics, History of European Ideas, and the Oxford Review of Education, and in several edited volumes.  Her book, Mere Civility: Disagreement and the Limits of Toleration (Harvard University Press) examines contemporary calls for civility in light of seventeenth-century debates about religious toleration.  Many of the pressing questions facing liberal democracies today -- such as what the proper scope of religious liberty should be and how to handle partisanship and hate speech -- closely recall early modern concerns about the limits of toleration and the dangers posed by sectarianism, evangelical expression, and so-called \"persecution of the tongue.\"  Then as a now, thinkers appealed to civility as a way to reconcile the tension between diversity and disagreement, but determining what civility requires can be complicated.  While some restraint on expression is surely necessary to make disagreement tolerable, accusations of incivility can easily become pretexts for persecution.  The book considers competing conceptions of civility developed by Roger Williams, Thomas Hobbes, and John Locke and argues that these were not superficial calls for politeness, but rather sophisticated efforts to think through what coexistence between people divided in their fundamental commitments requires.",

My books Creating States (1994) and The Romantic Performative (2000) approach literary texts from the viewpoint of verbal performativity, speech acts, and philosophies of language. Romanticism and Improvisation, 1750-1850 (2008) uncovers the popularity of on-stage poetic improvisers during the Romantic century, tracing the influence of improvisational poetry across Europe and showing how improvisation interacts with Romantic ideas about genius, spontaneity, orality, gender, and national identity (see also the online database The Improvisation of Poetry, 1750-1850 http://romanticimprov.utoronto.ca/ ). My current SSHRCC-funded project, Speculation, Improvisation, Mediality: The Late-Romantic Information Age, concerns experimental uses of textual, visual, and performative media during the 1820s and investigates the era's preoccupation with personal identity, celebrity, anonymity, and pseudonymity. In the course of this research I am working with literary magazines, innovative forms of theatre, and popular fiction, especially the work of the Scottish writer John Galt. As the General Editor of The Works of John Galt, I lead an international project to publish a 15-volume critical edition of Galts fiction and related non-fictional prose. Other areas covered in my research and teaching are English and German Romantic poetry (Blake, Coleridge, Wordsworth, Byron, Hemans, Landon, Hlderlin) and fiction (Scott, Godwin, Kleist, Stal).

He was elected to the Sphinx Head Society during his senior year. He held a variety of positions at the Public Service Electric and Gas Company in New Jersey, before being named in 1941 as chief of the Equipment Production Branch at the U.S. War Production Board. In mid-1943 he became chief engineer of power plants for Detroit Edison, but was granted leave of absence to become chief of public utilities for Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force with responsibility for rebuilding electrical power plants in Europe. In this role, he served in Sicily, visited Russia, and in August 1944 entered Paris with General Charles de Gaulle. By 1945 the French electric system was generating more power than it had before the war.\nAfter the war, Cisler returned to Detroit Edison as chief engineer, where he subsequently became executive vice president (1948), president (1951), chief executive officer (1954), and chairman of the board (1964). In 1967, Cisler became interested in supporting Northern Michigan Universitys business programs. As a result of this, the University renamed the school of business the \"Walker L. Cisler College of Business\".[2]\nHe was active in the early development of nuclear power, serving as executive secretary to the Atomic Energy Commission's Industrial Advisory Group in 1947-1948, and first president of the Atomic Industrial Forum. In 1991 the American Nuclear Society established a prize in honor of his contributions to development of fast breeder reactors.\nCisler was a founding member of the National Academy of Engineering, and a fellow of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, American Institute of Management, and American Nuclear Society. He served as president of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers, Engineers Joint Council, and Edison Electric Institute, and received awards from the American Society of Mechanical Engineers, Western Society of Engineers, American Institute of Consulting Engineers, National Society of Professional Engineers, and the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers.",

        "text": "David Blaschke started his scientific career at Rostock University where he got acquainted with Greens function methods in thermodynamic equilibrium and nonequilibrium, applied to the physics of strong correlations in nonideal plasmas. His Diploma thesis was on a Path Integral approach to collective modes (plasmons) and bound states in strongly correlated Fermion systems. Under the supervision of his teacher, Gerd Roepke, the dissolution of bound states under the influence of compression and heating (Mott effect) came into the focus of his scientific research. His Ph.D. studies were partly performed at the JINR Dubna where he studied the quark model of hadrons and published in 1985 the idea to describe deconfinement of hadrons as a Mott effect, developed further in his PhD thesis (1987) on The role of Pauli blocking effects in the equation of state for strongly interacting matter. \nAfter the PhD, David Blaschke worked on J/psi suppression in heavy-ion collisions. His idea to describe charmonium dissociation in hadronic matter by quark exchange led to a well-known paper and stimulated studies by other groups. During his postdoctoral fellowship at CERN (1991-92), he profited from contacts with John Ellis, Rolf Hagedorn, Joerg Huefner and Helmut Satz. He developed his studies of the QCD phase transition from a nonrelativistic Green function approach to a quantum field theoretical formulation as the basis for his habilitation (1995) on Quantum statistics for effective quark models of hadronic matter. During his assistant professorship on Particle and Astrophysics at Rostock University (1998-2004) he formed the major directions of his research: (i) signals of QCD phase transitions in heavy-ion collisions, (ii) quark matter in compact star interiors, and (iii) particle production in strong fields. \nDuring 2001-07 he was vice director of the Bogoliubov Laboratory for Theoretical Physics at JINR Dubna. After appointments at University Bielefeld and GSI Darmstadt he won a permanent professorship at University of Wroclaw in 2006. His present research is on the Mott dissociation of nucleons in hot and dense matter which is of fundamental importance for the upcoming heavy-ion collision experiments CBM @ FAIR and NICA @ JINR as well as for deconfinement in compact stars and during supernova collapse.",

In particular, the cAMP signaling cascade directs adaptive cellular responses to a variety of stress stimuli via a combination of acute affects arising from GS-protein coupled receptor (GPCR)-mediated activation of PKA and long-term affects resulting from transcriptional reprogramming directed by CREB and the CREB Regulated Transcription Coactivators (CTRCs). We are applying an interdisciplinary approach to study the consequences of aberrant activation of the cAMP/CREB/CRTC signal circuit on these adaptive responses and how cooperative signaling with other pathways promotes oncogenic processes in oral, head, and neck cancers. The information gathered from these studies is being directed towards drug discovery efforts.\nWe employ a wide variety of state-of-the-art technologies such as in vivo optical imaging and high-throughput methods including cell-based screening, genomics, and proteomics approaches. The lab recently developed novel LumiFluor optical reporters and are now implementing these reporters for the non-invasive, high resolution in vivo optical imaging of tumor development, progression, and response to therapeutic intervention in genetically engineered mouse models (GEMM) of cancer.\nAwards and Honors\n2019 First Place, IADR Joseph Lister Award for New Investigators\n2019 Invited Speaker, Annual Brigham and Womens Invited Speaker Series, Harvard Medical School\n2019 Invited Speaker, Gordon Research Conference on Salivary Glands and Exocrine Biology, Galveston, TX\n2019 Finalist, IADR Joseph Lister Award for New Investigators\n2018 Finalist, AADR Joseph Lister Award for New Investigators\n2017 IBM and R.

She received a B.S. degree in Biomedical and Electrical Engineering (1985), M.S. degree in Computer Engineering (1985), Engineers degree in Electrical Engineering (1988), and Ph.D. in Computer Engineering (1988), all from the University of Southern California (USC). She holds a J.D. degree from the Northwestern California University School of Law, and has graduated Cum Laude with an LL.M. degree from the Thomas Jefferson School of Law. Dr. Eshaghian-Wilner is currently an Adjunct Professor of Electrical Engineering at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). She is also a patent attorney admitted to the State Bar of California and the Washington D.C. Bar, and is registered to practice before the United States Patent and Trademark Office. Her academic work is comprised of over 20 years of research and leadership experience in various areas within the field of Parallel Architectures and Algorithms. Prior to joining UCLA, Professor Eshaghian-Wilner was a full Professor and Department Head at the Computer Engineering Department of the Rochester Institute of Technology. However, she is best known for her pioneering contributions to three areas of Optical Computing, Heterogeneous Computing, and Nanoscale Computing. In the area of Optical Computing, she produced one of the first theses that dealt with the computational aspects of optical interconnects for VLSI chips. The well-referenced OMC model was developed by Dr. Eshaghian-Wilner as part of her Ph.D. work, and since then many architectures and algorithms have been designed by Dr. Eshaghian-Wilner and others based on that model. In the area of Heterogeneous Computing, Dr. Eshaghian-Wilner is the editor of the field's first book, \"Heterogeneous Computing,\" and she is the co-founder of the IEEE Heterogeneous Computing Workshop. The well-known NSF-funded Cluster-M model was developed by Dr. Eshaghian-Wilner and her team as one of the first paradigms for executing heterogeneous applications to systems. The Cluster-M mapping is still the fastest known algorithm for mapping arbitrary task graphs onto arbitrary system graphs. Most recently, Dr. Eshaghian-Wilner has been focusing on the bio and nano applications of her work. One of her most notable results in this area involves the design of highly interconnected multiprocessor chips with spin waves that possess an unprecedented degree of interconnectivity that was not possible previously with electrical VLSI interconnects. Professor Eshaghian-Wilner is a founding series co-editor of \"Nature Inspired Computing\" for Wiley & Sons, and has edited the first book of this series, \"Bio-inspired and Nanoscale Integrated Computing\". Professor Eshaghian-Wilner has founded and/or chaired numerous IEEE conferences and organizations, including the IEEE Women in Engineering affinity division of the coastal Los Angeles section. She is the recipient of several IEEE and NSF awards.",

In it I extended the Tense Logic formalism of Arthur Prior to provide an\naccount of aspectual phenomena in language. This required the introduction of a far-reaching distinction\nbetween states and events, which was incorporated into the formalism. After gaining my PhD I revised\nmy thesis for publication; it was published in 1984 by Oxford University Press under the title The Logic of\nAspect: An Axiomatic Approach.\nI was appointed to a research fellowship in Philosophy at Leeds in 1985. There I continued working\non temporal logic formalisms, but now with a focus on potential applications in the area of Computer\nScience and Articial Intelligence. While there, I organised a conference on Temporal Logics and their\nApplications, which brought together both Computer Scientists and Philosophers for a fruitful two-day\nmeeting. A collection of papers from the conference, under my editorship, was published by Academic\nPress in 1987.\nI was appointed to a lectureship in Computer Science at Exeter in 1987.

I have worked on Articial Intelligence, Knowledge Representation, Logics for Temporal and Spatial Reasoning, Spatial and Temporal Ontologies, Geographical\nInformation Science, and the Philosophy of Computation Besides my conference and journal publications\nin these areas, I have published a book, Qualitative Spatial Change (OUP, 2000) which covers many of the\ntopics, computational, mathematical, and philosophical, which I have explored in my research.\nMy research on temporal reasoning in AI has been inuential in the eld, most particularly with regard\nto the question of how to choose the most appropriate formalism for a particular application (e.g., whether\nto use instants or intervals, reied or unreied formulae, rst-order or modal temporal logic). In the spatial\narea, my work has particularly addressed two issues which are recognised as being of major importance for\nthe future development of spatial information systems, namely the integration of object-based and eldbased representations, and the proper handling of the temporal dimension.

        "text": "My interests are and have been primarily in those aspects of elementary particles that relate to the tiniest constituents of matter and to the forces that the constituents use to communicate. During and after graduate school, these interests led me to investigate the selection rules by which the weak interactions are governed, particularly as demonstrated by the hadrons. The rules for changes in electric charge, strangeness, and isotopic spin that such experiments demonstrated were important in later giving credibility to the quarks as the elementary constituents of hadronic matter.\nIn the late 1960's, I began to concentrate on experimental studies of the deep inelastic scattering of leptons (neutrinos) by nucleons. This technique has been a principle instrument in understanding and verifying many aspects of particles and forces which are presently part of the Standard Model: (1) the validity of the quark hypothesis, (2) the existence of neutral-current weak interactions as predicted from synthesis of the weak and electromagnetic interactions, and (3) behavior of the strong force among quarks within the nucleon. My work on this program, which in its latter days came to be called the CCFR collaboration, continued until about 1990. More recently, this work was completed by Professors Shaevitz and Conrad from Columbia in the NuTev program.\nIn about 1985, I began working to prepare for the advent of a new era in deep inelastic scattering with the HERA accelerator. The machine was commissioned in 1991, and the ZEUS experiment began operation at that time. I have worked on taking and using HERA data since then. This novel collider permits observation of electron-proton collisions at energies more than a factor of 10 higher than previously available. My work at Columbia was done in collaboration with several past and present colleagues at Columbia, including Professors Caldwell and Parsons, and many other physicists throughout the world. We had an important role at Columbia in designing and constructing instrumentation, in accumulating and analyzing data for the ZEUS experiment, and in producing new scientific results. The first few years of operation demonstrated a new region of structure within the proton and new mechanisms to describe that structure. Later, we explored the scattering at energy transfers larger than the energies of the weak bosons.  The high event rates have permitted measurements of structure functions in unexplored kinematic regimes, unique tests of the Standard Model, and sensitivity to phenomena that lie outside the Standard Model that are complementarity to other techniques exploring these energy regimes.\nSince choosing emeritus status in 2004 and the completion of HERA operations, I have completed several analyses with ZEUS data with completing PhD students and look forward to more analyses from the data.  I also have continued relationships with the Fermilab Research Alliance (on the Fermilab Board of Trustees) and with the Sanford Laboratory, the site of the future national deep underground lab (as co-chair of the Experimental Advisory Committee).",

He was 95.\nPerkins joined the Princeton faculty in 1945 as part of a fledgling aeronautical engineering group and led the department in becoming the foremost in the nation in his quarter century as its chair. During leaves from Princeton and after retiring in 1978, Perkins served as chief scientist and undersecretary of the Air Force, chair of NATO's aerospace advisory group and president of the National Academy of Engineering.\nIn addition to his own research contributions -- his seminal 1949 text on aircraft stability and control is still in print -- Perkins was renowned for his ability to attract the best students and colleagues as well as the resources to support them.\nCourtland Davis Perkins was born Dec. 27, 1912, in Philadelphia and received his undergraduate degree from Swarthmore College. He earned a master's degree from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1941 and went to work at Wright Field, the legendary U.S. Army Air Corps testing ground for flight technology. The hands-on experience Perkins gained as leader of the Air Corps' Stability and Control Unit informed his teaching and research for years to come.\nFollowing World War II, in 1945, Perkins joined the Princeton faculty as an associate professor and was promoted within a year to full professor. In 1949, with Wright Field colleague Robert Hage, he published a book, \"Airplane Performance, Stability and Control,\" which became the standard text in the field and remains in print.\n\"During the war, as airplanes became faster and more powerful, problems that hadn't shown up in the past suddenly became apparent,\" said professor emeritus Howard \"Pat\" Curtiss, who earned his Ph.D. from Princeton in 1965 and joined the department faculty the same year.\nThe Perkins-Hage text provided a rigorous and practical guide for controlling the performance and stability of aircraft. \"His work on evaluating the handling characteristics of modern airplanes put the entire field of flight testing on a sound engineering basis for the first time,\" said Alexander Smits, the current chair of the Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering .\nIn 1951, Perkins became chair of the Department of Aeronautical Engineering and quickly demonstrated a talent for inspiring and managing strong-willed colleagues. \"As far as handling a disparate and sometimes prickly group of faculty members, he was magnificent,\" said David Hazen, who earned his bachelor's and master's degrees from the department in 1948 and 1949, respectively, and stayed on to become a faculty member.",

His group was the first to report the presence of cell-free fetal RNA and fetal epigenetic markers in maternal plasma and pioneered the use of such markers for noninvasive prenatal diagnosis. Dennis Lo and his colleagues were also the first to show that cell-free fetal nucleic acids in maternal plasma could be used for the noninvasive prenatal diagnosis of fetal trisomy 21 and had devised multiple solutions for this hitherto difficult diagnostic problem, including methods based on plasma RNA-SNP allelic ratios, plasma epigenetic markers, digital PCR and massively parallel DNA sequencing. With the use of massively parallel sequencing and the development of novel bioinformatics strategies, Dennis Lo's group succeeded at deciphering a genome-wide genetic map of the fetus through the analysis of the small amounts of fragmented DNA floating in the blood of pregnant women. This scientific achievement lays the foundation for developing non-invasive prenatal diagnostic tests for multiple genetic diseases in a non-invasive way.\nIn the area of cancer detection, Dennis Lo has pioneered a number of approaches to cancer liquid biopsy, especially for the detection of nasopharyngeal carcinoma and genomewide approaches for screening multiple types of cancer.\n \nIn recognition of his work, Dennis Lo has been the recipient of numerous awards, including the King Faisal International Prize in Medicine in 2014, the Future Science Prize - Life Science Prize in 2016 and the 2021 Breakthrough Prize in Life Sciences. He was elected as a Fellow of the Royal Society in 2011, as a Foreign Associate of the US National Academy of Sciences in 2013 and as a Founding Member of the Academy of Sciences of Hong Kong in 2015.",

        "text": "Felix Jiri Weinberg FRS (2 April 1928 5 December 2012) was a Czech physicist. He was Emeritus Professor of Combustion Physics and Distinguished Research Fellow at Imperial College London.[1]\nFelix Weinberg was born in the Sudeten part of Czechoslovakia. As a teenager he spent much of the war in Auschwitz, Buchenwald and other Nazi concentration camps. He arrived in England on V. J. day. Having had no formal schooling since the age of 12, he had to take his first degrees as an external student of the University of London. In 1951 he joined Imperial College as a Research Assistant, obtaining his Ph.D. in 1954 for developing novel optical methods to analyse the structure of flames. He was appointed to a Personal Chair as Professor of Combustion Physics in 1967.\nProfessor Weinberg is distinguished for his optical and electrical studies of flames and his pioneering development of innovative combustion methods. He originated a family of powerful optical tools in combustion, using both thermal [2] and laser light sources.[3] His work on electrical diagnostics led to applications of electric fields [4] to control combustion and improve understanding of ionisation and soot formation. He developed novel combustion devices[4] incorporating distinctive heat exchangers, permitting the ignition and burning of very low calorific fuel-air mixtures. These have had a seminal influence on the global evolution of environmentally benign combustion furnaces. His researches into the stabilisation of high intensity combustion using plasma jets[4] are being favoured as an approach to leaner burning jet engines. His work on laser ignition has progressed to understanding hazards associated with the use of optical fibres in flammable atmospheres.[5]\nHis wide-ranging services to academia, industry and scientific societies included visiting appointments at universities in Europe, the USA, Japan and Israel, consultancies for petroleum, chemical, aerospace and defence organisations and membership of committees and boards of governance of numerous scientific and professional bodies. He is author, coauthor, editor of 4 books and more than 220 papers in the scientific literature.\nHis many contributions have been recognized internationally; he was awarded a D.Sc. by the University of London (1961), both the Silver (1972) and the Bernard Lewis Gold (1980) Medals of the Combustion Institute, Fellowship of the Royal Society (1983), the Royal Society's Rumford Medal (1988), the D.Sc. Honoris Causa by The Technion, Haifa (1990), the Italgas Prize for Energy Sciences (Turin Academy, 1991), the Smolenski Medal of the Polish Academy of Science (1999) and was elected to the American National Academy of Engineering as a Foreign Associate in 2001. The Hugh Edwards Lifetime Achievement Award for contributions to Combustion Physics has been conferred on him in 2005 (Institute of Physics).\nAs a survivor of Nazi concentration camps he was highly critical of fraudulent Holocaust memoirs: 'I have always tended to avoid Holocaust literature and find some of the recent fictional accounts masquerading as true stories profoundly disturbing.'[6] His own account of his experiences in Nazi concentration camps 'Boy 30529: A Memoir', was published in 2013,[7] shortly after his death.",

        "text": "Robert H. Liebeck's contributions to wing design and the design of airplanes from high-altitude aircraft to subsonic transports impact many forms of air transportation today. In his 50 years at Boeing, he has served as program manager on several advanced-concept airplane programs. He has an extensive list of technical publications, and his airfoil work is discussed in several textbooks on aerodynamics. He attained world recognition starting in the 1970s with his novel designs for high-lift \"Liebeck airfoils.\"\nAs a world-renowned authority in the fields of aerodynamics and aircrafts design, Liebeck is a cocreator of the Blended-Wing-Body (BWB) subsonic transport airplane. In turn, he manages the BWB Program at Boeing, leading to the development of a 500-passanger flying-wing subsonic transport aircraft that offers the potential for a 30 percent reduction in fuel burn when compared to today's conventional tube and wing airplane configurations. The BWB X-48B, a subscale prototype with a 21-foot wingspan, is undergoing development byBoeing in collaboration with NASA.\nThe futuristic X-48B  an 8-percent sub-scale flight demonstrator of the Boeing Blended Wing Body (BWB) subsonic transport  was named one of the year's top inventions by Time magazine in 2007. Recognized for its innovative design and potential to be more fuel efficient and environmentally friendly than today's airplanes, the research aircraft is providing data that will transform air transportation.\nTo date, 93 test flights at NASA Dryden Flight Research Center (Edwards Air Force Base) have established that the X-48B flies like a normal airplane. Edge-of-the-flight envelope testing also has been successful. The X-48B is a joint project between the Boeing Company, NASA, and the Air Force Research Laboratory in Dayton, Ohio. Cranfield Aerospace of United Kingdom constructed the airplane.\nLiebeck also holds the position of Professor of the Practice of Aeronautics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and teaches courses in aerodynamics, flight mechanics, and airplane design as an adjunct professor at the University of California, Irvine. As a consultant, he has designed wings for racing cars that won in Indianapolis 500 and Formula One races, and his wing was selected for the NASCAR \"Car of Tomorrow\" recently. He also designed the keel section for the yacht that won the America's Cup in 1991, and he designed the wing for a World Championship aerobatic airplane.\nLiebeck received the Daniel Guggenheim Medal in 2010, one of the most prestigious awards in aviation. He is a member of the National Academy of Engineering and a Boeing Senior Technical Fellow, AIAA Honorary Fellow, and a Fellow of the Royal Aeronautical Society. He is a recipient of the AIAA Aerodynamics Award, AIAA Aircraft Design Award, AIAA Wright Brothers Lectureship in Aeronautics, ASME Spirit of St. Louis Medal, and ICAS Award for Innovation in Aeronautics. He received the Engineering at Illinois Alumni Award for Distinguished Service in 1994.",

After discovering that computers in the context of music performance don't play out of tune unless programmed to do so, Bruce soon realized that computer programming and design was not only fun, but could be made to pay.\nSo, he left the hallowed halls of academe for a position with a consulting engineering firm, where he gained valuable experience on projects such as a giant digital squirt gun used for injecting tenderizing enzymes into sides of beef; a digital flow-meter for the sewage-treatment industry; and a computerized poultry feeder designed to produce plump birds without feeding them to death.\nMarriage and a migration to Seattle brought a position as Director of Research for a telecommunications firm where Bruce was responsible for the design of a computerized voice-recognition-based automatic telephone dialer for telemarketing use, thereby creating an unprecedented number of junk phone calls-- precisely timed to arrive during the evening meal. (There is no truth in the rumor that this was merely to create demand for Bruce's invention, heretofore undeveloped, of a device to block junk telemarketing calls.)\nRealizing that the above telecommunications firm now needed blue-suited types instead of his type, Bruce quit-- dumping his stock options-- and once again became a consultant. After a series of digital signal processing projects for various audio companies, Bruce decided that the world really did need yet another audio company, so he and his partner founded a Seattle high-end digital audio firm in 1993.\nAfter pushing digital audio bits through DSPs for nine years, and manufacturing audio gear for Hollywood, Bruce decided enough really was enough, and left to pursue other interests. That brought him back to mystifying undergraduates again.",

Tropical regions are important for us because there is a lot of water in the atmosphere, and we expect stronger changes in the hydrological cycle there.\nDirk Sachse studied geology in Jena. Although he was interested in natural sciences rather early, he did not have a clear idea about his professional development as a child. His appetite for it came only while eating. I had no idea when I began my studies that there was something like what I am doing now. Traveling to the USA and Latin America, visiting national parks and the phenomenon of volcanos fascinated him so much that he turned to geology. During his studies, he was fascinated how climatic processes shape the earths surface and how sediments from the past offer clues about the climate of that time. He wanted to understand climate changes. He worked for his PhD at the Max-Planck-Institute for Biogeochemistry in Jena. There were always people who gave me the opportunity to work on completely new topics, Sachse says. Born in Halle, he definitely wanted to go abroad after his PhD. His scientific work since, has also taken him to Boston and Seattle.\nSince 2009 Sachse has led the Emmy Noether Research Group Paleohydrology at the Institute for Earth and Environmental Sciences, which is funded by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft. The geologists in his team study past climate changes on the continents throughout the more recent geological history  with a special focus on the Holocene (roughly the last 11,000 years). Sachse decided to work at Potsdam because of the terrestrial working groups there as well as good analytical facilities because he needs rather complex laboratories and analytical instrumentation for his analyses. I do not know of many other places in Germany where I could work in such an environment, he says.\nResearch Interests:\nMy research is aimed at understanding the variability of biogeochemical cycles over different timescales (101 to 106  years), as the basis of life, human societies and ecosystems.\nIn particluar I am interested in the mechansims and consequences of short-term changes to the hydrological cycle, and the influence of surface processes (erosion, riverine transport, mass wasting) and tectonics (mountain range uplfit, earthquakes) on the short-term and long-term development of the carbon cycle.I apply and develop organic geochemical methods and use molecular and isotopic information to detect changes in these cycles and quantify fluxes.\nResearch Boards and Committees:\nChair of the  INTIMATE (INtegrating Ice core, MArine and TErrestrial records) network (2019 - today)\nAwards:\n2018 - ERC Proof-of-concept grant (European Research Council)\n2015 - ERC Consolidator grant (European Research Council) \n2014 -   Isotope Prize of the Karleugen-Habfast-Foundation \n2009 - Emmy-Noether Excellence Grant of the DFG \n2005 - Alexander von Humboldt Posdoc fellowship",

I am also Senior Manager of the User Experience Technologies Department, a role that I took on recently. I have not yet hand a chance to update this page....so the information below is a bit dated. Previously I used to be Senior Manager, Speech Technologies Department which is part of the User Technologies Organization in IBM Research. Ive been in the Speech area at IBM Research since March 1994 working on and leading efforts addressing core speech recognition problems. I was until recently an Associate Editor of the IEEE Transactions in Speech and Audio Processing and a member of the Speech Technical Committee of the IEEE Signal Processing Society.\nResearch activities in my group cover all aspects of speech recognition  signal processing, acoustic modeling, language modeling, search, semantic interpretation, dialog management, post-deployment analysis and tuning, speech self-service diagnostics and audio-visual processing  and occur in the context of several projects. The Telephony Speech Recognition project is aimed at developing algorithms for improving the accuracy & robustness of speech recognition in conversational telephony applications e.g., bank transactions, directory assistance, etc. This project has significant product impact by directly contributing algorithms and data files for WebSphere Voice Server and related voice technology offerings from IBM. The Embedded Speech Recognition project addresses low-resource, robust speech recognition. A significant outgrowth of this ongoing project is ViaVoice for Embedded Multiplatforms, IBM's state-of-the-art speech recognition offering for the PDA, smartphone & automotive environments. Key focus research areas are robust signal processing & efficient search strategies. The Conversational Multimodal Interaction project (managed by Roberto Sicconi) is aimed at developing the next generation dialog management strategies for both embedded (primarily automotive) and server environments by exploiting the latest concepts in UI design and leveraging multiple input and output modalities in a complementary fashion for an unparalleled end-user experience. The Audio-Visual Speech Recognition project addresses the use of visual information for enhanced speech detection and recognition in high-noise environments e.g., moving car.\nLately I have become very interested in research problems in the contact center area. Enterprise contact centers are going through major shifts due to some key business/technology trends: voice-data convergence and the emergence of IP contact centers, migration of contact centers from cost centers to profit centers, customer contact analytics driving business insights beyond contact centers to all functional areas in an enterprise, the growing popularity of hosted contact centers giving small and medium businesses a cost-effective approach to best-of-breed contact centers, offshore outsourcing of contact center operations and infrastructture etc. This opens up several technical challenges with enormous possibilities for research in the areas of multi-channel interaction, self-service, agent performance and customer contact analytics. IBM Research has a large initiative in this area - the Contact Center of the Future Initiative - and I'm a principal in this area at IBM Research. ",

He pursued graduate level mathematics at Purdue University, earning his PhD in the subject under Glen Earl Baxter in 1967. After completing his studies, Stone joined Daniel H. Wagner, Associates, working on pertinent projects for the United States Navy and Coast Guard.\nDuring the 1968 search for the remains of the submarine Scorpion, Dr. Stone provided on-scene analysis assistance for six weeks near the Azores.  In 1974, he rendered on-scene assistance to the Navy in a search for unexplored ordnance in the Suez Canal. His early contributions to search theory came together in 1975sTheory of Optimal Search. The book was awarded that years Frederick W. Lanchester Prize for best publication in operations research and secured Stones reputation as a leading search theorist. In 1979, he served as co-director of the NATO Advance Research Institute on Search Theory and Applications in Portugal and co-editor of the resulting proceedings. In addition to his research and application, Stone has taught search theory courses part-time at the Naval Postgraduate School.\nAfter eighteen years at Daniel H. Wagner Associates, Stone joined Metron Inc. In 1986, he helped the Columbus America Discovery Group find the missing S.S. Central America, a mid-nineteenth century cargo vessel that had sunk over one and a half miles below the oceans surface. Stones application of search theory with Metron has continued into the twenty-first century. He led the companys efforts to provide search planning advice for the successful recovery of underwater wreckage from the 2009 Air France Flight 447 mid-Atlantic crash. Stone was Metrons Chief Operating Officer starting in 1990 prior to becoming Chief Executive Officer in 2004.\nIn 2007, Stone was awarded the Jacinto Steinhardt Prize of the Institute for Operations Research and the Management Sciences for his career contributions to military OR. In addition to his work with the Coast Guard and Navy, he was celebrated for his influential publications on search theory and probability mapping, including Theory of Optimal Search and Bayesian Multiple Target Tracking (Second Edition, 2014).\nStone is currently Chief Scientist at Metron, having stepped down from his duties as CEO in 2010. He continues to work on a number of projects, including the Coast Guards Search and Rescue Optimal Planning System. Since 2002, he has been a member of Antioch Universitys Board of Governors during which time he has served terms as its Chair and Vice Chair.",

        "text": "The application of modern mathematical methods to the solution of physical problems is fascinating and rewarding. Thus, while the major thrust of my research program is the development of physical theory, I also engage in the development of mathematical methods as they apply to nuclear and other subfields of physics.\nThe physical problems that intrigue me concern the ways in which the particles of many-body quantum systems interact to produce a variety of highly correlated collective phenomena. I am particularly concerned with developing a microscopic theory of the collective dynamics that take place in nuclear vibrations and rotations and with understanding the nature of the phase transitions that take place with variation of a control parameter.\nThe atomic nucleus can be viewed as a fluid of nuclear matter, as a gas of interacting neutrons and protons or, at the subnuclear level, as a system of quarks and gluons. Thus, as in other areas of physics, one seeks hierarchies of models and, for a complete understanding, one needs to know how each model relates to the next more microscopic model. By such means one learns how interesting physical phenomena emerge from the interactions and correlated dynamics of its elementary constituents.\nMy students, colleagues, and I have shown, for example, that the properties of a powerful hydrodynamic model of the nucleus, which exhibits vibrational and rotational dynamics with a variety of possible quantum fluid flows, can be embedded in many-nucleon quantum mechanics. The model can then be derived using the mathematical techniques of analysis by changing the neutron and proton variables to collective and intrinsic variables. It can be understood in geometrical terms, by factoring the multi-dimensional many-nucleon space into products of collective and intrinsic submanifolds, and also by algebraic methods that focus on the symmetries of the model and the expression of its algebra of observables in terms of many-nucleon observables.\nIt is clear that the above strategy for research has far-reaching applications to many areas of physics that have yet to be explored.",

Moving to Seattle in 1993 in search of rain, she was Boeing Professor of Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Washington. She has now moved to MIT in her continual search for worse weather and new fields to conquer. In the process, she somehow morphed herself into an aerospace engineer and has dual faculty positions in the MIT Dept. of Aeronautics and Astronautics and the Engineering Systems Division. \nProfessor Leveson started a new area of research, software safety, which is concerned with the problems of building software for real-time systems where failures can result in loss of life or property. One advantage of this topic is that nobody questions its goals, except for a few misanthropes (who don't matter anyway). She and her students produced a formal requirements specification for TCAS II, a real collision-avoidance system required on all commercial aircraft in U.S. airspace. One of the lessons she has learned from this project is never to do anything like it again. The FAA was pleased with it though and adopted it as their official specification. She claims that you should not read anything into the fact that she has been taking the train a lot lately. Our TCAS model is still being used to specify and evaluate potential upgrades to TCAS. Using this preliminary work, we have defined a complete system engineering environment for software-intensive systems that is based on model-driven development and a concept called Intent Specifications. A commercial set of tools was released to the unsuspecting world in June 2003. Most recently, she has been applying these tools to space projects (as if NASA does not have enough problems right now).",

With collaborators from nursing and other fields, I have contributed to an improved understanding of womens experiences of menstrual cycle symptoms as well as the menopausal transition, investigating endocrine, social, personal and genetic factors influencing symptoms and womens approaches to symptom management. In 1989 Dr. Joan Shaver and I, in collaboration with other colleagues, established the first NIH-funded Center for Womens Health Research at the University of Washington School of Nursing. Dr. Ellen and I established the Seattle Midlife Womens Health Study, a longitudinal study of women during the menopausal transition and early postmenopause, involving recruiting over 500 women, some of whom we studied for up to 25 years. I have been an investigator for the Womens Health Initiative Study and for the MsFLASH study of symptom management approaches for hot flashes and related symptoms. I was elected to the Institute of Medicine of the National Academies and to the American Academy of Nursing.\nDr. Ellen Mitchell and I investigated symptoms among community-dwelling reproductive-aged women using a health diary for longitudinal data collection, leading to identification of a variety of symptom patterns women experienced across the menstrual cycle. This early work led to a program of studies focusing on symptoms women experience during various stages of the menstrual cycle and during the menopausal transition. Current research focuses on symptom clusters during the menopausal transition and early postmenopause.\nI served as president of the American Academy of Nursing, the North American Menopause Society, and the Society for Menstrual Cycle Research. I have received the American Nurses Foundation Distinguished Contribution to Nursing Research Award, and in 2003, received the Pathfinder Award from the Friends of the National Institute for Nursing Research.

        "text": "Claudio Ciborra, Professor and Convenor of Information Systems at LSE, died in Milan, his hometown, on Sunday 13th February 2005, aged 53; finally losing his battle against cancer.\nClaudio had inspired many of us (and not just in Information Systems) with his innovative thinking about Information Technology and organizations long before he came to our department. We watched him at conferences defending surprisingly new and refreshing ideas, confronting the established gurus from the business schools  and always dressed in impeccable Italian style for such performances. \nIn 1998 he was invited to join the Department as a visiting professor, then in 2000 he was appointed to a full chair. When offering him the post, the selection committee asked if he was willing to take on the role of head of department. His answer, so typical of Claudio, was I want to be on the sun deck, not in the engine room. He took on the convenors role and from the beginning he steered firmly from that deck, though he never lost touch with the engine room. He brought Italian style to our department, and one of his first acts was to employ architects, and completely redesign the ambience of our offices. \nClaudio was an intellectually demanding leader. He expected us not only to do well in terms of conventional academic performance, but also, and more importantly, to secure an international reputation for creative thinking and forthright delivery. Always an iconoclast, he broke several conventions. His direct way of letting you know what he thought, and in particular what he didnt like, was challenging but never malicious, although he often angered even his closest friends  although no-one could stay angry for long with such a charming man. \nClaudio loved being at the LSE, where he totally submerged himself in the Schools intellectual and social life. He enjoyed living in London, and made many friends beyond the department and the School, making the most of the capitals multiple facets: the avant-garde East End, the Royal Opera, even the salsa nightclub at the basement of the LSE. He was also a true cosmopolitan, visiting friends and juggling professional engagements across Europe and North America, hopping from London to Oslo, to Berlin, to Milan, to Barcelona, to Boston with equal enthusiasm, to give a keynote speech, or organize a new research agenda, hear the Berlin Philharmonic, or to take part in swimming races.\nTruly intellectual, daring and uncompromising, yet always playful in his work as well as his personal life. Claudio leaves a huge influence in the shaping of a growing research stream on the social study of information and communication technology.",

(1953), M.A. (1954) and Ph.D. (1959) all in the field of Mathematics[1]. His M.A. degree was more specifically in Mathematical Statistics. His PhD dissertation was entitled \"The Use of Chebyshev Matrix Polynomials in the Iterative Solution of Linear Equations Compared to the Method of Successive Overrelaxation\" and his thesis adviser was Abraham Taub. He had been at Stanford since 1962 and became a professor there in 1970. He had advised almost thirty doctoral students, many of whom have themselves achieved distinction. Gene Golub was an important figure in numerical analysis and pivotal to creating the NA-Net and the NA-Digest, as well as the International Congress on Industrial and Applied Mathematics.[2]\nOne of his best-known books is Matrix Computations,[3] co-authored with Charles F. Van Loan. He was a major contributor to algorithms for matrix decompositions. In particular he published an algorithm together with William Kahan in 1970 that made the computation of the singular value decomposition (SVD) feasible and that is still used today. A survey of his work was published in 2007 by Oxford University Press as \"Milestones in Matrix Computation\".[4]\nGolub was awarded the B. Bolzano Gold Medal for Merits in the Field of Mathematical Sciences and was one of the rare few elected to three national academies: the National Academy of Sciences (1993), the National Academy of Engineering (1990), and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences (1994). He is listed as an ISI highly cited researcher.[5] He held 11 honorary doctorates and was scheduled to receive an honorary doctorate from ETH Zrich on November 17, 2007. He was a visiting professor at Princeton (1970), MIT (1979), ETH (1974 & 2002), and Oxford (1982 & 1998).\nGene Golub served as the president of the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics (SIAM) from 1985 to 1987 and was founding editor of both the SIAM Journal on Scientific Computing (SISC) and the SIAM Journal on Matrix Analysis and Applications (SIMAX).\nGene Golub succumbed to acute myeloid leukemia on the morning of 16 November 2007 at the Stanford Hospital.[6]",

His current focus is on the High Performance Wireless Research and Education Network (HPWREN) as Principal Investigator. Previously he was also Principal Investigator of the National Laboratory of Applied Network Research (NLANR), with a focus on network measurement and analysis activities. \nBraun was the Chief Network Architect with the Teledesic Corporation beginning in May 1996. Teledesic's objective was to to design a global broadband network for a system of hundreds of low earth orbit satellites. Braun remained a consultant to Teledesic for a few years, after moving back to San Diego to work at UCSD in 1997. \nPrior to his Teledesic position he began working at SDSC as a Principal Scientist in January 1991, and retained an affiliation as Senior Fellow with the Center while at Teledesic. While at SDSC, he was focusing on National Science Foundation supported efforts for NREN/NII engineering, strategic planning, and network performance related research. He created and was Project Director for the National Laboratory for Applied Network Research (NLANR), and Principal Investigator on various other NSF awards, including on information/web caching, network analysis, NREN engineering, and interagency ATM connectivity. \nBetween 1983 and 1991 he worked at the University of Michigan and the Merit Computer Network, a Michigan university networking consortium, on networking infrastructure. He became very involved in the early stages of the NSFNET networking efforts, and was the Co-Principal Investigator for the NSFNET backbone project since the 1987 NSFNET award to Merit. While being a Principal Investigator, the NSFNET backbone became the core interconnection network for the Internet, which enabled the Internet commercialization several years later. The NSFNET was key for driving the Internet technology from a DARPA research project which, in the wake of GOSIP and X.25, seemed on its way into oblivion in the mid-80s, towards an operationally accepted and commercialized globally available environment. \nFrom 1978 to 1983 he worked as an engineer responsible for the networking activities at the regional computing center of the University of Cologne in West Germany, which connected various universities in the state of Northrhine Westfalia. \nHans-Werner Braun received his engineering degree in Germany in 1978.

        "text": "John Woodhouse is first of all an exceptional theoretician. Combining refined mathematics with insightful physics, he developed many new ways of analysing seismic data. Most of his theoretical contributions led to important applications. Prominent examples are the CMT algorithm, the use of splitting functions to map Earth structure and his ingenious waveform inversion using asymptotic properties of normal modes. Most seismologists around the world still use codes developed by John or that can be traced back to him.20 years ago, Johns work resulted in the first 3D shear velocity model of the entire mantle and explained the anomalously split modes by inner core anisotropy. These models have only marginally changed over the years. The main improvements concerned the uppermost mantle, using high frequency surface waves, and the mid-mantle, using overtones, both directions started on a global scale by John in Oxford. All these achievements would not have been possible, if John Woodhouse had not a deep understanding and interest in seismic data. Upon arriving in Oxford in 1992, he built a waveform data base using ingenious software, all developed by himself. Most existing data centres acknowledge a request by email and the user has to download the data manually. John realised that it would be more flexible if the data centre would send the data directly to the user provided the user can make smart requests. This development allowed efficient and automatic data processing at an unprecedented scale. Surprisingly, 15 years later this still has not become the standard in most world data centres.Similar to Gutenberg, there are not many topics in seismology, John Woodhouse has not touched upon. Most prominently, he taught us that combining useful theory with powerful computers can revolutionise seismology. His thoughts on a given topic often set a trend for further analysis. Unsurprisingly, ISI has identified John has a highly cited researcher in his field, he has received 2 AGU medals and is a fellow of the Royal Society.",

Fascinated with radio as a boy, he became involved with Hertzian waves, first as an amateur and then as a professional.\nBefore World War II Kraus developed antennas including the corner reflector and W8JK close-spaced array. He also helped construct and operate the University of Michigan 100-ton cyclotron, then the world's most powerful particle accelerator. During World War II, Kraus did degaussing (protecting ships from magnetic mines) at the U.S. Naval Ordnance Laboratory and later developed antennas at the Radio Research Laboratory, Harvard University.\nIn 1946 Kraus joined the faculty of the Ohio State University. Soon after coming to Ohio State, he invented the helical antenna which became the workhorse of space communication. His corner-reflector invention came to be used by millions for TV reception, while his unique radio telescope design has been utilized in several European radio telescopes. He spent his career at Ohio State, rising to be the McDougal Professor of Electrical Engineering and Astronomy and Director of the Radio Observatory.\nPerhaps best known for his association with the Big Ear radio telescope, Kraus produced some of the first maps of the radio sky and co-discovered many of the most distant known objects in the universe. As inventor of antennas and builder of radio telescopes he was also a radio engineer. And as an educator, he taught and authored textbooks which span four decades. In addition to his textbooks (Radio Astronomy 2nd edition, 1986, Antennas 2nd edition, 1988, and Electromagnetics 4th edition, 1990), he wrote popular books as well, including Big Ear (1976) and Our Cosmic Universe (1980). Both independently and with students, he authored hundreds of research papers.\nKraus joined the IRE, one of the predecessor organizations of the IEEE in 1932. He became Chairman of its Detroit Section and for 15 years served as a member of the Editorial Board of the IRE Proceedings. He became a Fellow of the IEEE in 1954 and member of the National Academy of Engineering in 1972. In the 1950's he served on President Eisenhower's Science Advisory Committee and also the committee which established the National Radio Astronomy Observatory.\nKraus many awards include the Sullivant Medal from the Ohio State University (1970), the Outstanding Achievement Award of the University of Michigan (1981) and the Centennial Medal (1984). In 1985 he was awarded the IEEE Edison Medal in 1985 \"For a sustained career as an innovator, discoverer, and educator in the fields of antennas and radio astronomy.\"",

        "text": "Chandrakant Patel is an HP Senior Fellow and director of the Sustainable Ecosystems Research Group at Hewlett-Packard Laboratories. Patel has been a pioneer in microprocessor and system thermo-mechanical architectures, management of available energy as a key resource in \"smart\" data centers, and most recently, application of the IT ecosystem to enable a net positive impact on the environment. He has transcended conventional thinking in sustainability through a holistic, systemic and fundamentals based approach, in sharp contrast to the cookbook approaches that focus solely on greenhouse gas emissions. He has changed the conversation in sustainability to address lifetime resource consumption by using Joules of available energy or exergy as the currency.\nPatel joined HP Labs in 1991, initially leading the cooling and packaging research of the Wide Word microprocessor. He founded the thermal technology research program, and with partners in the R&D groups, started a virtual thermal community - the vibrant HP Cool Team - to productize the electronics cooling research in HP Laboratories. Through the 90s, he charted the directions in thermo-mechanical research that led to innovations in chip and system cooling solutions. In the late 90s, he initiated the research in smart data centers. He foresaw the need to reduce available energy consumption by dynamically provisioning IT, power and cooling resources in the data center, arguing that the data center is the computer. It led to the development of an end-to-end management system to address data center energy consumption and the total cost of ownership.\nAn advocate of return to fundamentals of science and engineering, Patel passionately shares his work by teaching in community colleges and universities. He has taught computer aided design at Chabot College in Hayward, California for 16 years. He has also taught courses in thermal and energy management at U.C. Berkeley Extension, Santa Clara University and San Jose State University.\nPatel has been honored as a distinguished alumnus by the City College of San Francisco and by the Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering Department at San Jose State University. Patel holds an AS from the City College of San Francisco, BSME from U.C. Berkeley, MSME from San Jose State University, and is a licensed professional mechanical engineer in the State of California.\nIn recognition of his work in the community, Patel was profiled by ABC-KGO television in its Emmy Award winning series \"Profiles of Excellence\" for contributions to science, technology and education.",
